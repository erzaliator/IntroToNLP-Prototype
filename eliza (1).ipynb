This cautious approach is essential as false positives can lead to legitimate comments being wrongly filtered out, causing user dissatisfaction and limiting user engagement. However, the relatively lower recall (0.67) indicates that there is room for improvement in capturing more spam comments. Striking a balance between precision and recall is crucial to maintain the bot's credibility and avoid annoying false positives while still catching a substantial number of spam comments.\n",

On the other hand, prioritizing recall may lead to more false positives, impacting the user experience. Striking the right balance is necessary to optimize the bot's performance."
