Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace. \\n Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO \\n\\n \\n PHILO \\n Nay, but this dotage of our general's \\n O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes, \\n That o'er the files and musters of the war \\n Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, \\n The office and devotion of their view \\n Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart, \\n Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst \\n The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper, \\n And is become the bellows and the fan \\n To cool a gipsy's lust. \\n Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,\\nthe Train, with Eunuchs fanning her \\n Look, where they come: \\n Take but good note, and you shall see in him. \\n The triple pillar of the world transform'd \\n Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n If it be love indeed, tell me how much. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter an Attendant \\n\\n \\n Attendant \\n News, my good lord, from Rome. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Grates me: the sum. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Nay, hear them, Antony: \\n Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows \\n If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent \\n His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this; \\n Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that; \\n Perform 't, or else we damn thee.' \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n How, my love! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Perchance! nay, and most like: \\n You must not stay here longer, your dismission \\n Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony. \\n Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both? \\n Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen, \\n Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine \\n Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame \\n When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch \\n Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space. \\n Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike \\n Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life \\n Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair \\n Embracing \\n And such a twain can do't, in which I bind, \\n On pain of punishment, the world to weet \\n We stand up peerless. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Excellent falsehood! \\n Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her? \\n I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony \\n Will be himself. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n But stirr'd by Cleopatra. \\n Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours, \\n Let's not confound the time with conference harsh: \\n There's not a minute of our lives should stretch \\n Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Hear the ambassadors. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Fie, wrangling queen! \\n Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh, \\n To weep; whose every passion fully strives \\n To make itself, in thee, fair and admired! \\n No messenger, but thine; and all alone \\n To-night we'll wander through the streets and note \\n The qualities of people. Come, my queen; \\n Last night you did desire it: speak not to us. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with\\ntheir train \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight? \\n \\n\\n \\n PHILO \\n Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony, \\n He comes too short of that great property \\n Which still should go with Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I am full sorry \\n That he approves the common liar, who \\n Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope \\n Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  The same. Another room. \\n Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, \\n almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer \\n that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew \\n this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns \\n with garlands! \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Soothsayer! \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Your will? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n In nature's infinite book of secrecy \\n A little I can read. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Show him your hand. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough \\n Cleopatra's health to drink. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Good sir, give me good fortune. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n I make not, but foresee. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Pray, then, foresee me one. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n You shall be yet far fairer than you are. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n He means in flesh. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n No, you shall paint when you are old. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Wrinkles forbid! \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Vex not his prescience; be attentive. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Hush! \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n You shall be more beloving than beloved. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n I had rather heat my liver with drinking. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Nay, hear him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married \\n to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all: \\n let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry \\n may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius \\n Caesar, and companion me with my mistress. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n You shall outlive the lady whom you serve. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n O excellent! I love long life better than figs. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune \\n Than that which is to approach. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Then belike my children shall have no names: \\n prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n If every of your wishes had a womb. \\n And fertile every wish, a million. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Nay, come, tell Iras hers. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n We'll know all our fortunes. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall \\n be--drunk to bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful \\n prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, \\n tell her but a worky-day fortune. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Your fortunes are alike. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n But how, but how? give me particulars. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n I have said. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Am I not an inch of fortune better than she? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than \\n I, where would you choose it? \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Not in my husband's nose. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come, \\n his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman \\n that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let \\n her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst \\n follow worse, till the worst of all follow him \\n laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good \\n Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a \\n matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! \\n for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man \\n loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a \\n foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep \\n decorum, and fortune him accordingly! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Amen. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a \\n cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but \\n they'ld do't! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Hush! here comes Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Not he; the queen. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CLEOPATRA \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Saw you my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n No, lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Was he not here? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n No, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden \\n A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Madam? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Seek him, and bring him hither. \\n Where's Alexas? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Here, at your service. My lord approaches. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n We will not look upon him: go with us. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt \\n Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Fulvia thy wife first came into the field. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Against my brother Lucius? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Ay: \\n But soon that war had end, and the time's state \\n Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar; \\n Whose better issue in the war, from Italy, \\n Upon the first encounter, drave them. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Well, what worst? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n The nature of bad news infects the teller. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n When it concerns the fool or coward. On: \\n Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus: \\n Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death, \\n I hear him as he flatter'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Labienus-- \\n This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force, \\n Extended Asia from Euphrates; \\n His conquering banner shook from Syria \\n To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst-- \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Antony, thou wouldst say,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n O, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue: \\n Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome; \\n Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults \\n With such full licence as both truth and malice \\n Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds, \\n When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us \\n Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n At your noble pleasure. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Attendant \\n The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Attendant \\n He stays upon your will. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Let him appear. \\n These strong Egyptian fetters I must break, \\n Or lose myself in dotage. \\n Enter another Messenger \\n What are you? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Messenger \\n Fulvia thy wife is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Where died she? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Messenger \\n In Sicyon: \\n Her length of sickness, with what else more serious \\n Importeth thee to know, this bears. \\n \\n\\n\\n Gives a letter \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Forbear me. \\n Exit Second Messenger \\n There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it: \\n What our contempt doth often hurl from us, \\n We wish it ours again; the present pleasure, \\n By revolution lowering, does become \\n The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone; \\n The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on. \\n I must from this enchanting queen break off: \\n Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know, \\n My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus! \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n What's your pleasure, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I must with haste from hence. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Why, then, we kill all our women: \\n we see how mortal an unkindness is to them; \\n if they suffer our departure, death's the word. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I must be gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were \\n pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between \\n them and a great cause, they should be esteemed \\n nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of \\n this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty \\n times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is \\n mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon \\n her, she hath such a celerity in dying. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n She is cunning past man's thought. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit ALEXAS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but \\n the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her \\n winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater \\n storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this \\n cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a \\n shower of rain as well as Jove. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Would I had never seen her. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece \\n of work; which not to have been blest withal would \\n have discredited your travel. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Fulvia is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Fulvia is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Fulvia! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When \\n it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man \\n from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; \\n comforting therein, that when old robes are worn \\n out, there are members to make new. If there were \\n no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, \\n and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned \\n with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new \\n petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion \\n that should water this sorrow. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n The business she hath broached in the state \\n Cannot endure my absence. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n And the business you have broached here cannot be \\n without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which \\n wholly depends on your abode. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n No more light answers. Let our officers \\n Have notice what we purpose. I shall break \\n The cause of our expedience to the queen, \\n And get her leave to part. For not alone \\n The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, \\n Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too \\n Of many our contriving friends in Rome \\n Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius \\n Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands \\n The empire of the sea: our slippery people, \\n Whose love is never link'd to the deserver \\n Till his deserts are past, begin to throw \\n Pompey the Great and all his dignities \\n Upon his son; who, high in name and power, \\n Higher than both in blood and life, stands up \\n For the main soldier: whose quality, going on, \\n The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding, \\n Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life, \\n And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure, \\n To such whose place is under us, requires \\n Our quick remove from hence. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I shall do't. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  The same. Another room. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Where is he? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n I did not see him since. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n See where he is, who's with him, what he does: \\n I did not send you: if you find him sad, \\n Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report \\n That I am sudden sick: quick, and return. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit ALEXAS \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly, \\n You do not hold the method to enforce \\n The like from him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What should I do, I do not? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n In each thing give him way, cross him nothing. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear: \\n In time we hate that which we often fear. \\n But here comes Antony. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MARK ANTONY \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I am sick and sullen. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall: \\n It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature \\n Will not sustain it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Now, my dearest queen,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Pray you, stand further from me. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n What's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I know, by that same eye, there's some good news. \\n What says the married woman? You may go: \\n Would she had never given you leave to come! \\n Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here: \\n I have no power upon you; hers you are. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n The gods best know,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O, never was there queen \\n So mightily betray'd! yet at the first \\n I saw the treasons planted. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Cleopatra,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Why should I think you can be mine and true, \\n Though you in swearing shake the throned gods, \\n Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness, \\n To be entangled with those mouth-made vows, \\n Which break themselves in swearing! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Most sweet queen,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going, \\n But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying, \\n Then was the time for words: no going then; \\n Eternity was in our lips and eyes, \\n Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor, \\n But was a race of heaven: they are so still, \\n Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, \\n Art turn'd the greatest liar. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n How now, lady! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know \\n There were a heart in Egypt. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Hear me, queen: \\n The strong necessity of time commands \\n Our services awhile; but my full heart \\n Remains in use with you. Our Italy \\n Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius \\n Makes his approaches to the port of Rome: \\n Equality of two domestic powers \\n Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength, \\n Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey, \\n Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace, \\n Into the hearts of such as have not thrived \\n Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; \\n And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge \\n By any desperate change: my more particular, \\n And that which most with you should safe my going, \\n Is Fulvia's death. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Though age from folly could not give me freedom, \\n It does from childishness: can Fulvia die? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n She's dead, my queen: \\n Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read \\n The garboils she awaked; at the last, best: \\n See when and where she died. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O most false love! \\n Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill \\n With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see, \\n In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know \\n The purposes I bear; which are, or cease, \\n As you shall give the advice. By the fire \\n That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence \\n Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war \\n As thou affect'st. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Cut my lace, Charmian, come; \\n But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well, \\n So Antony loves. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n My precious queen, forbear; \\n And give true evidence to his love, which stands \\n An honourable trial. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n So Fulvia told me. \\n I prithee, turn aside and weep for her, \\n Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears \\n Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene \\n Of excellent dissembling; and let it look \\n Life perfect honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n You'll heat my blood: no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n You can do better yet; but this is meetly. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Now, by my sword,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n And target. Still he mends; \\n But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian, \\n How this Herculean Roman does become \\n The carriage of his chafe. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I'll leave you, lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Courteous lord, one word. \\n Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it: \\n Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it; \\n That you know well: something it is I would, \\n O, my oblivion is a very Antony, \\n And I am all forgotten. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n But that your royalty \\n Holds idleness your subject, I should take you \\n For idleness itself. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n 'Tis sweating labour \\n To bear such idleness so near the heart \\n As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me; \\n Since my becomings kill me, when they do not \\n Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence; \\n Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly. \\n And all the gods go with you! upon your sword \\n Sit laurel victory! and smooth success \\n Be strew'd before your feet! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Let us go. Come; \\n Our separation so abides, and flies, \\n That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me, \\n And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS,\\nand their Train \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know, \\n It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate \\n Our great competitor: from Alexandria \\n This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes \\n The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like \\n Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy \\n More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or \\n Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there \\n A man who is the abstract of all faults \\n That all men follow. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n I must not think there are \\n Evils enow to darken all his goodness: \\n His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven, \\n More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary, \\n Rather than purchased; what he cannot change, \\n Than what he chooses. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not \\n Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy; \\n To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit \\n And keep the turn of tippling with a slave; \\n To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet \\n With knaves that smell of sweat: say this \\n becomes him,-- \\n As his composure must be rare indeed \\n Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony \\n No way excuse his soils, when we do bear \\n So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd \\n His vacancy with his voluptuousness, \\n Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones, \\n Call on him for't: but to confound such time, \\n That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud \\n As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid \\n As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge, \\n Pawn their experience to their present pleasure, \\n And so rebel to judgment. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Messenger \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Here's more news. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Thy biddings have been done; and every hour, \\n Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report \\n How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea; \\n And it appears he is beloved of those \\n That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports \\n The discontents repair, and men's reports \\n Give him much wrong'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I should have known no less. \\n It hath been taught us from the primal state, \\n That he which is was wish'd until he were; \\n And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love, \\n Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body, \\n Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, \\n Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide, \\n To rot itself with motion. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Caesar, I bring thee word, \\n Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, \\n Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound \\n With keels of every kind: many hot inroads \\n They make in Italy; the borders maritime \\n Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt: \\n No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon \\n Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more \\n Than could his war resisted. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Antony, \\n Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once \\n Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st \\n Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel \\n Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against, \\n Though daintily brought up, with patience more \\n Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink \\n The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle \\n Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign \\n The roughest berry on the rudest hedge; \\n Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets, \\n The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps \\n It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh, \\n Which some did die to look on: and all this-- \\n It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-- \\n Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek \\n So much as lank'd not. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n 'Tis pity of him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Let his shames quickly \\n Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain \\n Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end \\n Assemble we immediate council: Pompey \\n Thrives in our idleness. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n To-morrow, Caesar, \\n I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly \\n Both what by sea and land I can be able \\n To front this present time. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Till which encounter, \\n It is my business too. Farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime \\n Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir, \\n To let me be partaker. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Doubt not, sir; \\n I knew it for my bond. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Charmian! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Madam? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Ha, ha! \\n Give me to drink mandragora. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Why, madam? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n That I might sleep out this great gap of time \\n My Antony is away. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n You think of him too much. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O, 'tis treason! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Madam, I trust, not so. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Thou, eunuch Mardian! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARDIAN \\n What's your highness' pleasure? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure \\n In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee, \\n That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts \\n May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARDIAN \\n Yes, gracious madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Indeed! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARDIAN \\n Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing \\n But what indeed is honest to be done: \\n Yet have I fierce affections, and think \\n What Venus did with Mars. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O Charmian, \\n Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he? \\n Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? \\n O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony! \\n Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest? \\n The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm \\n And burgonet of men. He's speaking now, \\n Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?' \\n For so he calls me: now I feed myself \\n With most delicious poison. Think on me, \\n That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black, \\n And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar, \\n When thou wast here above the ground, I was \\n A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey \\n Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow; \\n There would he anchor his aspect and die \\n With looking on his life. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Sovereign of Egypt, hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n How much unlike art thou Mark Antony! \\n Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath \\n With his tinct gilded thee. \\n How goes it with my brave Mark Antony? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Last thing he did, dear queen, \\n He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,-- \\n This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Mine ear must pluck it thence. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n 'Good friend,' quoth he, \\n 'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends \\n This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot, \\n To mend the petty present, I will piece \\n Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east, \\n Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded, \\n And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed, \\n Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke \\n Was beastly dumb'd by him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What, was he sad or merry? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Like to the time o' the year between the extremes \\n Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O well-divided disposition! Note him, \\n Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him: \\n He was not sad, for he would shine on those \\n That make their looks by his; he was not merry, \\n Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay \\n In Egypt with his joy; but between both: \\n O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry, \\n The violence of either thee becomes, \\n So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Ay, madam, twenty several messengers: \\n Why do you send so thick? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Who's born that day \\n When I forget to send to Antony, \\n Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian. \\n Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian, \\n Ever love Caesar so? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n O that brave Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Be choked with such another emphasis! \\n Say, the brave Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n The valiant Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth, \\n If thou with Caesar paragon again \\n My man of men. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n By your most gracious pardon, \\n I sing but after you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n My salad days, \\n When I was green in judgment: cold in blood, \\n To say as I said then! But, come, away; \\n Get me ink and paper: \\n He shall have every day a several greeting, \\n Or I'll unpeople Egypt. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT II \\n\\n SCENE I.  Messina. POMPEY's house. \\n Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in\\nwarlike manner \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n If the great gods be just, they shall assist \\n The deeds of justest men. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENECRATES \\n Know, worthy Pompey, \\n That what they do delay, they not deny. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays \\n The thing we sue for. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENECRATES \\n We, ignorant of ourselves, \\n Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers \\n Deny us for our good; so find we profit \\n By losing of our prayers. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n I shall do well: \\n The people love me, and the sea is mine; \\n My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope \\n Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony \\n In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make \\n No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where \\n He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both, \\n Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves, \\n Nor either cares for him. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Caesar and Lepidus \\n Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Where have you this? 'tis false. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n From Silvius, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n He dreams: I know they are in Rome together, \\n Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love, \\n Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip! \\n Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both! \\n Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, \\n Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks \\n Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite; \\n That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour \\n Even till a Lethe'd dulness! \\n Enter VARRIUS \\n How now, Varrius! \\n \\n\\n \\n VARRIUS \\n This is most certain that I shall deliver: \\n Mark Antony is every hour in Rome \\n Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis \\n A space for further travel. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n I could have given less matter \\n A better ear. Menas, I did not think \\n This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm \\n For such a petty war: his soldiership \\n Is twice the other twain: but let us rear \\n The higher our opinion, that our stirring \\n Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck \\n The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n I cannot hope \\n Caesar and Antony shall well greet together: \\n His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar; \\n His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think, \\n Not moved by Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n I know not, Menas, \\n How lesser enmities may give way to greater. \\n Were't not that we stand up against them all, \\n 'Twere pregnant they should square between \\n themselves; \\n For they have entertained cause enough \\n To draw their swords: but how the fear of us \\n May cement their divisions and bind up \\n The petty difference, we yet not know. \\n Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands \\n Our lives upon to use our strongest hands. \\n Come, Menas. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Rome. The house of LEPIDUS. \\n Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed, \\n And shall become you well, to entreat your captain \\n To soft and gentle speech. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I shall entreat him \\n To answer like himself: if Caesar move him, \\n Let Antony look over Caesar's head \\n And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter, \\n Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard, \\n I would not shave't to-day. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n 'Tis not a time \\n For private stomaching. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Every time \\n Serves for the matter that is then born in't. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n But small to greater matters must give way. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Not if the small come first. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Your speech is passion: \\n But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes \\n The noble Antony. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n And yonder, Caesar. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n If we compose well here, to Parthia: \\n Hark, Ventidius. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I do not know, \\n Mecaenas; ask Agrippa. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Noble friends, \\n That which combined us was most great, and let not \\n A leaner action rend us. What's amiss, \\n May it be gently heard: when we debate \\n Our trivial difference loud, we do commit \\n Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners, \\n The rather, for I earnestly beseech, \\n Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms, \\n Nor curstness grow to the matter. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n 'Tis spoken well. \\n Were we before our armies, and to fight. \\n I should do thus. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Welcome to Rome. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Thank you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Sit. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Sit, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Nay, then. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I learn, you take things ill which are not so, \\n Or being, concern you not. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I must be laugh'd at, \\n If, or for nothing or a little, I \\n Should say myself offended, and with you \\n Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should \\n Once name you derogately, when to sound your name \\n It not concern'd me. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n My being in Egypt, Caesar, \\n What was't to you? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n No more than my residing here at Rome \\n Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there \\n Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt \\n Might be my question. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n How intend you, practised? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n You may be pleased to catch at mine intent \\n By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother \\n Made wars upon me; and their contestation \\n Was theme for you, you were the word of war. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n You do mistake your business; my brother never \\n Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it; \\n And have my learning from some true reports, \\n That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather \\n Discredit my authority with yours; \\n And make the wars alike against my stomach, \\n Having alike your cause? Of this my letters \\n Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, \\n As matter whole you have not to make it with, \\n It must not be with this. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n You praise yourself \\n By laying defects of judgment to me; but \\n You patch'd up your excuses. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Not so, not so; \\n I know you could not lack, I am certain on't, \\n Very necessity of this thought, that I, \\n Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought, \\n Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars \\n Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife, \\n I would you had her spirit in such another: \\n The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle \\n You may pace easy, but not such a wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Would we had all such wives, that the men might go \\n to wars with the women! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar \\n Made out of her impatience, which not wanted \\n Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant \\n Did you too much disquiet: for that you must \\n But say, I could not help it. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I wrote to you \\n When rioting in Alexandria; you \\n Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts \\n Did gibe my missive out of audience. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Sir, \\n He fell upon me ere admitted: then \\n Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want \\n Of what I was i' the morning: but next day \\n I told him of myself; which was as much \\n As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow \\n Be nothing of our strife; if we contend, \\n Out of our question wipe him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n You have broken \\n The article of your oath; which you shall never \\n Have tongue to charge me with. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Soft, Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n No, \\n Lepidus, let him speak: \\n The honour is sacred which he talks on now, \\n Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar; \\n The article of my oath. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n To lend me arms and aid when I required them; \\n The which you both denied. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Neglected, rather; \\n And then when poison'd hours had bound me up \\n From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may, \\n I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty \\n Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power \\n Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia, \\n To have me out of Egypt, made wars here; \\n For which myself, the ignorant motive, do \\n So far ask pardon as befits mine honour \\n To stoop in such a case. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n 'Tis noble spoken. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n If it might please you, to enforce no further \\n The griefs between ye: to forget them quite \\n Were to remember that the present need \\n Speaks to atone you. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Worthily spoken, Mecaenas. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Or, if you borrow one another's love for the \\n instant, you may, when you hear no more words of \\n Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to \\n wrangle in when you have nothing else to do. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Thou art a soldier only: speak no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n That truth should be silent I had almost forgot. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Go to, then; your considerate stone. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I do not much dislike the matter, but \\n The manner of his speech; for't cannot be \\n We shall remain in friendship, our conditions \\n So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew \\n What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge \\n O' the world I would pursue it. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Give me leave, Caesar,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Speak, Agrippa. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Thou hast a sister by the mother's side, \\n Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony \\n Is now a widower. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Say not so, Agrippa: \\n If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof \\n Were well deserved of rashness. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I am not married, Caesar: let me hear \\n Agrippa further speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n To hold you in perpetual amity, \\n To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts \\n With an unslipping knot, take Antony \\n Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims \\n No worse a husband than the best of men; \\n Whose virtue and whose general graces speak \\n That which none else can utter. By this marriage, \\n All little jealousies, which now seem great, \\n And all great fears, which now import their dangers, \\n Would then be nothing: truths would be tales, \\n Where now half tales be truths: her love to both \\n Would, each to other and all loves to both, \\n Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke; \\n For 'tis a studied, not a present thought, \\n By duty ruminated. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Will Caesar speak? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd \\n With what is spoke already. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n What power is in Agrippa, \\n If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,' \\n To make this good? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n The power of Caesar, and \\n His power unto Octavia. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n May I never \\n To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, \\n Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand: \\n Further this act of grace: and from this hour \\n The heart of brothers govern in our loves \\n And sway our great designs! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n There is my hand. \\n A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother \\n Did ever love so dearly: let her live \\n To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never \\n Fly off our loves again! \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Happily, amen! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey; \\n For he hath laid strange courtesies and great \\n Of late upon me: I must thank him only, \\n Lest my remembrance suffer ill report; \\n At heel of that, defy him. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Time calls upon's: \\n Of us must Pompey presently be sought, \\n Or else he seeks out us. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Where lies he? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n About the mount Misenum. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n What is his strength by land? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Great and increasing: but by sea \\n He is an absolute master. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n So is the fame. \\n Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it: \\n Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we \\n The business we have talk'd of. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n With most gladness: \\n And do invite you to my sister's view, \\n Whither straight I'll lead you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Let us, Lepidus, \\n Not lack your company. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Noble Antony, \\n Not sickness should detain me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY,\\nand LEPIDUS \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n Welcome from Egypt, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My \\n honourable friend, Agrippa! \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Good Enobarbus! \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n We have cause to be glad that matters are so well \\n digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and \\n made the night light with drinking. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and \\n but twelve persons there; is this true? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more \\n monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to \\n her. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up \\n his heart, upon the river of Cydnus. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised \\n well for her. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I will tell you. \\n The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, \\n Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold; \\n Purple the sails, and so perfumed that \\n The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, \\n Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made \\n The water which they beat to follow faster, \\n As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, \\n It beggar'd all description: she did lie \\n In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue-- \\n O'er-picturing that Venus where we see \\n The fancy outwork nature: on each side her \\n Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, \\n With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem \\n To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, \\n And what they undid did. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n O, rare for Antony! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, \\n So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes, \\n And made their bends adornings: at the helm \\n A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle \\n Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands, \\n That yarely frame the office. From the barge \\n A strange invisible perfume hits the sense \\n Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast \\n Her people out upon her; and Antony, \\n Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone, \\n Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy, \\n Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, \\n And made a gap in nature. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Rare Egyptian! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, \\n Invited her to supper: she replied, \\n It should be better he became her guest; \\n Which she entreated: our courteous Antony, \\n Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak, \\n Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, \\n And for his ordinary pays his heart \\n For what his eyes eat only. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Royal wench! \\n She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed: \\n He plough'd her, and she cropp'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I saw her once \\n Hop forty paces through the public street; \\n And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted, \\n That she did make defect perfection, \\n And, breathless, power breathe forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n Now Antony must leave her utterly. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Never; he will not: \\n Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale \\n Her infinite variety: other women cloy \\n The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry \\n Where most she satisfies; for vilest things \\n Become themselves in her: that the holy priests \\n Bless her when she is riggish. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle \\n The heart of Antony, Octavia is \\n A blessed lottery to him. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Let us go. \\n Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest \\n Whilst you abide here. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Humbly, sir, I thank you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. \\n Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between\\nthem, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n The world and my great office will sometimes \\n Divide me from your bosom. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n All which time \\n Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers \\n To them for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Good night, sir. My Octavia, \\n Read not my blemishes in the world's report: \\n I have not kept my square; but that to come \\n Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady. \\n Good night, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Good night. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA \\n Enter Soothsayer \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n If you can, your reason? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n I see it in \\n My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet \\n Hie you to Egypt again. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Say to me, \\n Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Caesar's. \\n Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side: \\n Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is \\n Noble, courageous high, unmatchable, \\n Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel \\n Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore \\n Make space enough between you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Speak this no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n To none but thee; no more, but when to thee. \\n If thou dost play with him at any game, \\n Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck, \\n He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens, \\n When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit \\n Is all afraid to govern thee near him; \\n But, he away, 'tis noble. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Get thee gone: \\n Say to Ventidius I would speak with him: \\n Exit Soothsayer \\n He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap, \\n He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him; \\n And in our sports my better cunning faints \\n Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds; \\n His cocks do win the battle still of mine, \\n When it is all to nought; and his quails ever \\n Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt: \\n And though I make this marriage for my peace, \\n I' the east my pleasure lies. \\n Enter VENTIDIUS \\n O, come, Ventidius, \\n You must to Parthia: your commission's ready; \\n Follow me, and receive't. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  The same. A street. \\n Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten \\n Your generals after. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Sir, Mark Antony \\n Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress, \\n Which will become you both, farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n We shall, \\n As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount \\n Before you, Lepidus. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Your way is shorter; \\n My purposes do draw me much about: \\n You'll win two days upon me. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n AGRIPPA \\n Sir, good success! \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Farewell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Give me some music; music, moody food \\n Of us that trade in love. \\n \\n\\n \\n Attendants \\n The music, ho! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MARDIAN \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n My arm is sore; best play with Mardian. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n As well a woman with an eunuch play'd \\n As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARDIAN \\n As well as I can, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n And when good will is show'd, though't come \\n too short, \\n The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now: \\n Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there, \\n My music playing far off, I will betray \\n Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce \\n Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up, \\n I'll think them every one an Antony, \\n And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.' \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n 'Twas merry when \\n You wager'd on your angling; when your diver \\n Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he \\n With fervency drew up. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n That time,--O times!-- \\n I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night \\n I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn, \\n Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed; \\n Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst \\n I wore his sword Philippan. \\n Enter a Messenger \\n O, from Italy \\n Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, \\n That long time have been barren. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Madam, madam,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain, \\n Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free, \\n If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here \\n My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings \\n Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n First, madam, he is well. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Why, there's more gold. \\n But, sirrah, mark, we use \\n To say the dead are well: bring it to that, \\n The gold I give thee will I melt and pour \\n Down thy ill-uttering throat. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Good madam, hear me. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Well, go to, I will; \\n But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony \\n Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour \\n To trumpet such good tidings! If not well, \\n Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes, \\n Not like a formal man. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Will't please you hear me? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st: \\n Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, \\n Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, \\n I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail \\n Rich pearls upon thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Madam, he's well. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Well said. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n And friends with Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Thou'rt an honest man. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Caesar and he are greater friends than ever. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Make thee a fortune from me. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n But yet, madam,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay \\n The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'! \\n 'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth \\n Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend, \\n Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, \\n The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar: \\n In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Free, madam! no; I made no such report: \\n He's bound unto Octavia. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n For what good turn? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n For the best turn i' the bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I am pale, Charmian. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Madam, he's married to Octavia. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n The most infectious pestilence upon thee! \\n \\n\\n\\n Strikes him down \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Good madam, patience. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What say you? Hence, \\n Strikes him again \\n Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes \\n Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head: \\n She hales him up and down \\n Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine, \\n Smarting in lingering pickle. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Gracious madam, \\n I that do bring the news made not the match. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee, \\n And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst \\n Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage; \\n And I will boot thee with what gift beside \\n Thy modesty can beg. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n He's married, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Rogue, thou hast lived too long. \\n \\n\\n\\n Draws a knife \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Nay, then I'll run. \\n What mean you, madam? I have made no fault. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Good madam, keep yourself within yourself: \\n The man is innocent. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt. \\n Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures \\n Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again: \\n Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n He is afeard to come. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I will not hurt him. \\n Exit CHARMIAN \\n These hands do lack nobility, that they strike \\n A meaner than myself; since I myself \\n Have given myself the cause. \\n Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger \\n Come hither, sir. \\n Though it be honest, it is never good \\n To bring bad news: give to a gracious message. \\n An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell \\n Themselves when they be felt. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n I have done my duty. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Is he married? \\n I cannot hate thee worser than I do, \\n If thou again say 'Yes.' \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n He's married, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Should I lie, madam? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O, I would thou didst, \\n So half my Egypt were submerged and made \\n A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence: \\n Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me \\n Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n I crave your highness' pardon. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n He is married? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Take no offence that I would not offend you: \\n To punish me for what you make me do. \\n Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O, that his fault should make a knave of thee, \\n That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence: \\n The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome \\n Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand, \\n And be undone by 'em! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Messenger \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Good your highness, patience. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Many times, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I am paid for't now. \\n Lead me from hence: \\n I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter. \\n Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him \\n Report the feature of Octavia, her years, \\n Her inclination, let him not leave out \\n The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly. \\n Exit ALEXAS \\n Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian, \\n Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon, \\n The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas \\n To MARDIAN \\n Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian, \\n But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Near Misenum. \\n Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,\\nwith drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,\\nMARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS,\\nwith Soldiers marching \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Your hostages I have, so have you mine; \\n And we shall talk before we fight. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Most meet \\n That first we come to words; and therefore have we \\n Our written purposes before us sent; \\n Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know \\n If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword, \\n And carry back to Sicily much tall youth \\n That else must perish here. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n To you all three, \\n The senators alone of this great world, \\n Chief factors for the gods, I do not know \\n Wherefore my father should revengers want, \\n Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar, \\n Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted, \\n There saw you labouring for him. What was't \\n That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what \\n Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus, \\n With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom, \\n To drench the Capitol; but that they would \\n Have one man but a man? And that is it \\n Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen \\n The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant \\n To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome \\n Cast on my noble father. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Take your time. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails; \\n We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st \\n How much we do o'er-count thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n At land, indeed, \\n Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house: \\n But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself, \\n Remain in't as thou mayst. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Be pleased to tell us-- \\n For this is from the present--how you take \\n The offers we have sent you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n There's the point. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Which do not be entreated to, but weigh \\n What it is worth embraced. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n And what may follow, \\n To try a larger fortune. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n You have made me offer \\n Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must \\n Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send \\n Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon \\n To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back \\n Our targes undinted. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n MARK ANTONY \\n LEPIDUS \\n That's our offer. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Know, then, \\n I came before you here a man prepared \\n To take this offer: but Mark Antony \\n Put me to some impatience: though I lose \\n The praise of it by telling, you must know, \\n When Caesar and your brother were at blows, \\n Your mother came to Sicily and did find \\n Her welcome friendly. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I have heard it, Pompey; \\n And am well studied for a liberal thanks \\n Which I do owe you. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Let me have your hand: \\n I did not think, sir, to have met you here. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you, \\n That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither; \\n For I have gain'd by 't. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Since I saw you last, \\n There is a change upon you. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Well, I know not \\n What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face; \\n But in my bosom shall she never come, \\n To make my heart her vassal. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Well met here. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed: \\n I crave our composition may be written, \\n And seal'd between us. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n That's the next to do. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's \\n Draw lots who shall begin. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n That will I, Pompey. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n No, Antony, take the lot: but, first \\n Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery \\n Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar \\n Grew fat with feasting there. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n You have heard much. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n I have fair meanings, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n And fair words to them. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Then so much have I heard: \\n And I have heard, Apollodorus carried-- \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n No more of that: he did so. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n What, I pray you? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Well; \\n And well am like to do; for, I perceive, \\n Four feasts are toward. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Let me shake thy hand; \\n I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight, \\n When I have envied thy behavior. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Sir, \\n I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye, \\n When you have well deserved ten times as much \\n As I have said you did. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Enjoy thy plainness, \\n It nothing ill becomes thee. \\n Aboard my galley I invite you all: \\n Will you lead, lords? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n MARK ANTONY \\n LEPIDUS \\n Show us the way, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Come. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Aside   Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have \\n made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n At sea, I think. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n We have, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n You have done well by water. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n And you by land. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I will praise any man that will praise me; though it \\n cannot be denied what I have done by land. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Nor what I have done by water. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Yes, something you can deny for your own \\n safety: you have been a great thief by sea. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n And you by land. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n There I deny my land service. But give me your \\n hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they \\n might take two thieves kissing. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n But there is never a fair woman has a true face. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n No slander; they steal hearts. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n We came hither to fight with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. \\n Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony \\n here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Caesar's sister is called Octavia. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Pray ye, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n 'Tis true. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would \\n not prophesy so. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n I think the policy of that purpose made more in the \\n marriage than the love of the parties. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I think so too. But you shall find, the band that \\n seems to tie their friendship together will be the \\n very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a \\n holy, cold, and still conversation. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Who would not have his wife so? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. \\n He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the \\n sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as \\n I said before, that which is the strength of their \\n amity shall prove the immediate author of their \\n variance. Antony will use his affection where it is: \\n he married but his occasion here. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? \\n I have a health for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Come, let's away. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VII.  On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum. \\n Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with\\na banquet \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are \\n ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world \\n will blow them down. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Servant \\n Lepidus is high-coloured. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n They have made him drink alms-drink. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Servant \\n As they pinch one another by the disposition, he \\n cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his \\n entreaty, and himself to the drink. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n But it raises the greater war between him and \\n his discretion. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Servant \\n Why, this is to have a name in great men's \\n fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do \\n me no service as a partisan I could not heave. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen \\n to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, \\n which pitifully disaster the cheeks. \\n \\n\\n\\n A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK\\nANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS,\\nDOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n To OCTAVIUS CAESAR   Thus do they, sir: they take \\n the flow o' the Nile \\n By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know, \\n By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth \\n Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells, \\n The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman \\n Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, \\n And shortly comes to harvest. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n You've strange serpents there. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Ay, Lepidus. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the \\n operation of your sun: so is your crocodile. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n They are so. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus! \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' \\n pyramises are very goodly things; without \\n contradiction, I have heard that. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Aside to POMPEY   Pompey, a word. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Aside to MENAS                  Say in mine ear: \\n what is't? \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Aside to POMPEY   Forsake thy seat, I do beseech \\n thee, captain, \\n And hear me speak a word. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Aside to MENAS   Forbear me till anon. \\n This wine for Lepidus! \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n What manner o' thing is your crocodile? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad \\n as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is, \\n and moves with its own organs: it lives by that \\n which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of \\n it, it transmigrates. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n What colour is it of? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Of it own colour too. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n 'Tis a strange serpent. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Will this description satisfy him? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a \\n very epicure. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Aside to MENAS   Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of \\n that? away! \\n Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for? \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Aside to POMPEY   If for the sake of merit thou \\n wilt hear me, \\n Rise from thy stool. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Aside to MENAS   I think thou'rt mad. \\n The matter? \\n \\n\\n\\n Rises, and walks aside \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say? \\n Be jolly, lords. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n These quick-sands, Lepidus, \\n Keep off them, for you sink. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Wilt thou be lord of all the world? \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n What say'st thou? \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n How should that be? \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n But entertain it, \\n And, though thou think me poor, I am the man \\n Will give thee all the world. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Hast thou drunk well? \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup. \\n Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove: \\n Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips, \\n Is thine, if thou wilt ha't. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Show me which way. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n These three world-sharers, these competitors, \\n Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable; \\n And, when we are put off, fall to their throats: \\n All there is thine. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Ah, this thou shouldst have done, \\n And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany; \\n In thee't had been good service. Thou must know, \\n 'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour; \\n Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue \\n Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown, \\n I should have found it afterwards well done; \\n But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Aside   For this, \\n I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more. \\n Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd, \\n Shall never find it more. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n This health to Lepidus! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Here's to thee, Menas! \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Enobarbus, welcome! \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Fill till the cup be hid. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n There's a strong fellow, Menas. \\n \\n\\n\\n Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Why? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st \\n not? \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all, \\n That it might go on wheels! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Drink thou; increase the reels. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Come. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n This is not yet an Alexandrian feast. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho? \\n Here is to Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I could well forbear't. \\n It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain, \\n And it grows fouler. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Be a child o' the time. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Possess it, I'll make answer: \\n But I had rather fast from all four days \\n Than drink so much in one. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Ha, my brave emperor! \\n To MARK ANTONY \\n Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals, \\n And celebrate our drink? \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n Let's ha't, good soldier. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Come, let's all take hands, \\n Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense \\n In soft and delicate Lethe. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n All take hands. \\n Make battery to our ears with the loud music: \\n The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing; \\n The holding every man shall bear as loud \\n As his strong sides can volley. \\n Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them\\nhand in hand \\n THE SONG. \\n Come, thou monarch of the vine, \\n Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne! \\n In thy fats our cares be drown'd, \\n With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd: \\n Cup us, till the world go round, \\n Cup us, till the world go round! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother, \\n Let me request you off: our graver business \\n Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part; \\n You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb \\n Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue \\n Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost \\n Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night. \\n Good Antony, your hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n I'll try you on the shore. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n And shall, sir; give's your hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n POMPEY \\n O Antony, \\n You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends. \\n Come, down into the boat. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Take heed you fall not. \\n Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS \\n Menas, I'll not on shore. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n No, to my cabin. \\n These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what! \\n Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell \\n To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out! \\n \\n\\n\\n Sound a flourish, with drums \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Ho! says a' There's my cap. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENAS \\n Ho! Noble captain, come. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.  A plain in Syria. \\n Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,\\nand other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead\\nbody of PACORUS borne before him \\n\\n \\n VENTIDIUS \\n Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now \\n Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death \\n Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body \\n Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes, \\n Pays this for Marcus Crassus. \\n \\n\\n \\n SILIUS \\n Noble Ventidius, \\n Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm, \\n The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media, \\n Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither \\n The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony \\n Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and \\n Put garlands on thy head. \\n \\n\\n \\n VENTIDIUS \\n O Silius, Silius, \\n I have done enough; a lower place, note well, \\n May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius; \\n Better to leave undone, than by our deed \\n Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away. \\n Caesar and Antony have ever won \\n More in their officer than person: Sossius, \\n One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant, \\n For quick accumulation of renown, \\n Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour. \\n Who does i' the wars more than his captain can \\n Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition, \\n The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss, \\n Than gain which darkens him. \\n I could do more to do Antonius good, \\n But 'twould offend him; and in his offence \\n Should my performance perish. \\n \\n\\n \\n SILIUS \\n Thou hast, Ventidius, \\n that \\n Without the which a soldier, and his sword, \\n Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony! \\n \\n\\n \\n VENTIDIUS \\n I'll humbly signify what in his name, \\n That magical word of war, we have effected; \\n How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks, \\n The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia \\n We have jaded out o' the field. \\n \\n\\n \\n SILIUS \\n Where is he now? \\n \\n\\n \\n VENTIDIUS \\n He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste \\n The weight we must convey with's will permit, \\n We shall appear before him. On there; pass along! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. \\n Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\\nat another \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n What, are the brothers parted? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone; \\n The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps \\n To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus, \\n Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled \\n With the green sickness. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n 'Tis a noble Lepidus. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n What's Antony? The god of Jupiter. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil! \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n O Antony! O thou Arabian bird! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony: \\n Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, \\n poets, cannot \\n Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho! \\n His love to Antony. But as for Caesar, \\n Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Both he loves. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n They are his shards, and he their beetle. \\n Trumpets within \\n So; \\n This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n No further, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n You take from me a great part of myself; \\n Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife \\n As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band \\n Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony, \\n Let not the piece of virtue, which is set \\n Betwixt us as the cement of our love, \\n To keep it builded, be the ram to batter \\n The fortress of it; for better might we \\n Have loved without this mean, if on both parts \\n This be not cherish'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Make me not offended \\n In your distrust. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I have said. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n You shall not find, \\n Though you be therein curious, the least cause \\n For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you, \\n And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends! \\n We will here part. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well: \\n The elements be kind to thee, and make \\n Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n My noble brother! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring, \\n And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n What, Octavia? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n I'll tell you in your ear. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can \\n Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's \\n down-feather, \\n That stands upon the swell at full of tide, \\n And neither way inclines. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside to AGRIPPA   Will Caesar weep? \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS   He has a cloud in 's face. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside to AGRIPPA   He were the worse for that, \\n were he a horse; \\n So is he, being a man. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS   Why, Enobarbus, \\n When Antony found Julius Caesar dead, \\n He cried almost to roaring; and he wept \\n When at Philippi he found Brutus slain. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside to AGRIPPA   That year, indeed, he was \\n troubled with a rheum; \\n What willingly he did confound he wail'd, \\n Believe't, till I wept too. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n No, sweet Octavia, \\n You shall hear from me still; the time shall not \\n Out-go my thinking on you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Come, sir, come; \\n I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love: \\n Look, here I have you; thus I let you go, \\n And give you to the gods. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Adieu; be happy! \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Let all the number of the stars give light \\n To thy fair way! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Farewell, farewell! \\n \\n\\n\\n Kisses OCTAVIA \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Farewell! \\n \\n\\n\\n Trumpets sound. Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Where is the fellow? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Half afeard to come. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Go to, go to. \\n Enter the Messenger as before \\n Come hither, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALEXAS \\n Good majesty, \\n Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you \\n But when you are well pleased. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n That Herod's head \\n I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone \\n Through whom I might command it? Come thou near. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Most gracious majesty,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Didst thou behold Octavia? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Ay, dread queen. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Where? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Madam, in Rome; \\n I look'd her in the face, and saw her led \\n Between her brother and Mark Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Is she as tall as me? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n She is not, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n That's not so good: he cannot like her long. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish! \\n What majesty is in her gait? Remember, \\n If e'er thou look'dst on majesty. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n She creeps: \\n Her motion and her station are as one; \\n She shows a body rather than a life, \\n A statue than a breather. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Is this certain? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Or I have no observance. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Three in Egypt \\n Cannot make better note. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n He's very knowing; \\n I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet: \\n The fellow has good judgment. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Excellent. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Guess at her years, I prithee. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Madam, \\n She was a widow,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Widow! Charmian, hark. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n And I do think she's thirty. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Round even to faultiness. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. \\n Her hair, what colour? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Brown, madam: and her forehead \\n As low as she would wish it. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n There's gold for thee. \\n Thou must not take my former sharpness ill: \\n I will employ thee back again; I find thee \\n Most fit for business: go make thee ready; \\n Our letters are prepared. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Messenger \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n A proper man. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Indeed, he is so: I repent me much \\n That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him, \\n This creature's no such thing. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Nothing, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n The man hath seen some majesty, and should know. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend, \\n And serving you so long! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian: \\n But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me \\n Where I will write. All may be well enough. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n I warrant you, madam. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house. \\n Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,-- \\n That were excusable, that, and thousands more \\n Of semblable import,--but he hath waged \\n New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it \\n To public ear: \\n Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not \\n But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly \\n He vented them; most narrow measure lent me: \\n When the best hint was given him, he not took't, \\n Or did it from his teeth. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n O my good lord, \\n Believe not all; or, if you must believe, \\n Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady, \\n If this division chance, ne'er stood between, \\n Praying for both parts: \\n The good gods me presently, \\n When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!' \\n Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud, \\n 'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother, \\n Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway \\n 'Twixt these extremes at all. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Gentle Octavia, \\n Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks \\n Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour, \\n I lose myself: better I were not yours \\n Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested, \\n Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady, \\n I'll raise the preparation of a war \\n Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste; \\n So your desires are yours. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n Thanks to my lord. \\n The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak, \\n Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be \\n As if the world should cleave, and that slain men \\n Should solder up the rift. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n When it appears to you where this begins, \\n Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults \\n Can never be so equal, that your love \\n Can equally move with them. Provide your going; \\n Choose your own company, and command what cost \\n Your heart has mind to. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  The same. Another room. \\n Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n How now, friend Eros! \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n There's strange news come, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n What, man? \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n This is old: what is the success? \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst \\n Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let \\n him partake in the glory of the action: and not \\n resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly \\n wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so \\n the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more; \\n And throw between them all the food thou hast, \\n They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony? \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns \\n The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!' \\n And threats the throat of that his officer \\n That murder'd Pompey. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Our great navy's rigg'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius; \\n My lord desires you presently: my news \\n I might have told hereafter. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n 'Twill be naught: \\n But let it be. Bring me to Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Come, sir. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more, \\n In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't: \\n I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd, \\n Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold \\n Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat \\n Caesarion, whom they call my father's son, \\n And all the unlawful issue that their lust \\n Since then hath made between them. Unto her \\n He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her \\n Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia, \\n Absolute queen. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n This in the public eye? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I' the common show-place, where they exercise. \\n His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings: \\n Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia. \\n He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd \\n Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she \\n In the habiliments of the goddess Isis \\n That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience, \\n As 'tis reported, so. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n Let Rome be thus Inform'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Who, queasy with his insolence \\n Already, will their good thoughts call from him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n The people know it; and have now received \\n His accusations. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Who does he accuse? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Caesar: and that, having in Sicily \\n Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him \\n His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me \\n Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets \\n That Lepidus of the triumvirate \\n Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain \\n All his revenue. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Sir, this should be answer'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n 'Tis done already, and the messenger gone. \\n I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel; \\n That he his high authority abused, \\n And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd, \\n I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia, \\n And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I \\n Demand the like. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n He'll never yield to that. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Nor must not then be yielded to in this. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter OCTAVIA with her train \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n That ever I should call thee castaway! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not \\n Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony \\n Should have an army for an usher, and \\n The neighs of horse to tell of her approach \\n Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way \\n Should have borne men; and expectation fainted, \\n Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust \\n Should have ascended to the roof of heaven, \\n Raised by your populous troops: but you are come \\n A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented \\n The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown, \\n Is often left unloved; we should have met you \\n By sea and land; supplying every stage \\n With an augmented greeting. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n Good my lord, \\n To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did \\n On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony, \\n Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted \\n My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd \\n His pardon for return. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Which soon he granted, \\n Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n Do not say so, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n I have eyes upon him, \\n And his affairs come to me on the wind. \\n Where is he now? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n My lord, in Athens. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra \\n Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire \\n Up to a whore; who now are levying \\n The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled \\n Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus, \\n Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king \\n Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; \\n King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont; \\n Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king \\n Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas, \\n The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, \\n With a more larger list of sceptres. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n Ay me, most wretched, \\n That have my heart parted betwixt two friends \\n That do afflict each other! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Welcome hither: \\n Your letters did withhold our breaking forth; \\n Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led, \\n And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart; \\n Be you not troubled with the time, which drives \\n O'er your content these strong necessities; \\n But let determined things to destiny \\n Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome; \\n Nothing more dear to me. You are abused \\n Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods, \\n To do you justice, make them ministers \\n Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort; \\n And ever welcome to us. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n Welcome, lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n Welcome, dear madam. \\n Each heart in Rome does love and pity you: \\n Only the adulterous Antony, most large \\n In his abominations, turns you off; \\n And gives his potent regiment to a trull, \\n That noises it against us. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIA \\n Is it so, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you, \\n Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VII.  Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I will be even with thee, doubt it not. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n But why, why, why? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars, \\n And say'st it is not fit. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Well, is it, is it? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n If not denounced against us, why should not we \\n Be there in person? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside   Well, I could reply: \\n If we should serve with horse and mares together, \\n The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear \\n A soldier and his horse. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What is't you say? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Your presence needs must puzzle Antony; \\n Take from his heart, take from his brain, \\n from's time, \\n What should not then be spared. He is already \\n Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome \\n That Photinus an eunuch and your maids \\n Manage this war. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Sink Rome, and their tongues rot \\n That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war, \\n And, as the president of my kingdom, will \\n Appear there for a man. Speak not against it: \\n I will not stay behind. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Nay, I have done. \\n Here comes the emperor. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Is it not strange, Canidius, \\n That from Tarentum and Brundusium \\n He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea, \\n And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Celerity is never more admired \\n Than by the negligent. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n A good rebuke, \\n Which might have well becomed the best of men, \\n To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we \\n Will fight with him by sea. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n By sea! what else? \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Why will my lord do so? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n For that he dares us to't. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n So hath my lord dared him to single fight. \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia. \\n Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers, \\n Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off; \\n And so should you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Your ships are not well mann'd; \\n Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people \\n Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet \\n Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought: \\n Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace \\n Shall fall you for refusing him at sea, \\n Being prepared for land. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n By sea, by sea. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Most worthy sir, you therein throw away \\n The absolute soldiership you have by land; \\n Distract your army, which doth most consist \\n Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted \\n Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego \\n The way which promises assurance; and \\n Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard, \\n From firm security. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I'll fight at sea. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I have sixty sails, Caesar none better. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Our overplus of shipping will we burn; \\n And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium \\n Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail, \\n We then can do't at land. \\n Enter a Messenger \\n Thy business? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n The news is true, my lord; he is descried; \\n Caesar has taken Toryne. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible; \\n Strange that power should be. Canidius, \\n Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, \\n And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship: \\n Away, my Thetis! \\n Enter a Soldier \\n How now, worthy soldier? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n O noble emperor, do not fight by sea; \\n Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt \\n This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians \\n And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we \\n Have used to conquer, standing on the earth, \\n And fighting foot to foot. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Well, well: away! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS\\nENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n By Hercules, I think I am i' the right. \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows \\n Not in the power on't: so our leader's led, \\n And we are women's men. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n You keep by land \\n The legions and the horse whole, do you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, \\n Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea: \\n But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's \\n Carries beyond belief. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n While he was yet in Rome, \\n His power went out in such distractions as \\n Beguiled all spies. \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Who's his lieutenant, hear you? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n They say, one Taurus. \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Well I know the man. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Messenger \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n The emperor calls Canidius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n With news the time's with labour, and throes forth, \\n Each minute, some. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VIII.  A plain near Actium. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and TAURUS, with his army, marching \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Taurus! \\n \\n\\n \\n TAURUS \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle, \\n Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed \\n The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies \\n Upon this jump. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IX.  Another part of the plain. \\n Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill, \\n In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place \\n We may the number of the ships behold, \\n And so proceed accordingly. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE X.  Another part of the plain. \\n CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over\\nthe stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS\\nCAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is\\nheard the noise of a sea-fight \\n Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer: \\n The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, \\n With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder: \\n To see't mine eyes are blasted. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter SCARUS \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n Gods and goddesses, \\n All the whole synod of them! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n What's thy passion! \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n The greater cantle of the world is lost \\n With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away \\n Kingdoms and provinces. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n How appears the fight? \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n On our side like the token'd pestilence, \\n Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,-- \\n Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight, \\n When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd, \\n Both as the same, or rather ours the elder, \\n The breese upon her, like a cow in June, \\n Hoists sails and flies. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n That I beheld: \\n Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not \\n Endure a further view. \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n She once being loof'd, \\n The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, \\n Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard, \\n Leaving the fight in height, flies after her: \\n I never saw an action of such shame; \\n Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before \\n Did violate so itself. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Alack, alack! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CANIDIUS \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Our fortune on the sea is out of breath, \\n And sinks most lamentably. Had our general \\n Been what he knew himself, it had gone well: \\n O, he has given example for our flight, \\n Most grossly, by his own! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Ay, are you thereabouts? \\n Why, then, good night indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n Toward Peloponnesus are they fled. \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend \\n What further comes. \\n \\n\\n \\n CANIDIUS \\n To Caesar will I render \\n My legions and my horse: six kings already \\n Show me the way of yielding. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I'll yet follow \\n The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason \\n Sits in the wind against me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE XI.  Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. \\n Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't; \\n It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither: \\n I am so lated in the world, that I \\n Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship \\n Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly, \\n And make your peace with Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Fly! not we. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards \\n To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone; \\n I have myself resolved upon a course \\n Which has no need of you; be gone: \\n My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O, \\n I follow'd that I blush to look upon: \\n My very hairs do mutiny; for the white \\n Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them \\n For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall \\n Have letters from me to some friends that will \\n Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad, \\n Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint \\n Which my despair proclaims; let that be left \\n Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway: \\n I will possess you of that ship and treasure. \\n Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now: \\n Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command, \\n Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by. \\n \\n\\n Sits down \\n Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS\\nfollowing \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Do, most dear queen. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Do! why: what else? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Let me sit down. O Juno! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n No, no, no, no, no. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n See you here, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n O fie, fie, fie! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Madam! \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Madam, O good empress! \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Sir, sir,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept \\n His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck \\n The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I \\n That the mad Brutus ended: he alone \\n Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had \\n In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Ah, stand by. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n The queen, my lord, the queen. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Go to him, madam, speak to him: \\n He is unqualitied with very shame. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Well then, sustain him: O! \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches: \\n Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but \\n Your comfort makes the rescue. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I have offended reputation, \\n A most unnoble swerving. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Sir, the queen. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See, \\n How I convey my shame out of thine eyes \\n By looking back what I have left behind \\n 'Stroy'd in dishonour. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O my lord, my lord, \\n Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought \\n You would have follow'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Egypt, thou knew'st too well \\n My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings, \\n And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit \\n Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that \\n Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods \\n Command me. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O, my pardon! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Now I must \\n To the young man send humble treaties, dodge \\n And palter in the shifts of lowness; who \\n With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased, \\n Making and marring fortunes. You did know \\n How much you were my conqueror; and that \\n My sword, made weak by my affection, would \\n Obey it on all cause. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Pardon, pardon! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates \\n All that is won and lost: give me a kiss; \\n Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster; \\n Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead. \\n Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows \\n We scorn her most when most she offers blows. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE XII.  Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Let him appear that's come from Antony. \\n Know you him? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster: \\n An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither \\n He sends so poor a pinion off his wing, \\n Which had superfluous kings for messengers \\n Not many moons gone by. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Approach, and speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n EUPHRONIUS \\n Such as I am, I come from Antony: \\n I was of late as petty to his ends \\n As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf \\n To his grand sea. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Be't so: declare thine office. \\n \\n\\n \\n EUPHRONIUS \\n Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and \\n Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted, \\n He lessens his requests; and to thee sues \\n To let him breathe between the heavens and earth, \\n A private man in Athens: this for him. \\n Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness; \\n Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves \\n The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, \\n Now hazarded to thy grace. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n For Antony, \\n I have no ears to his request. The queen \\n Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she \\n From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend, \\n Or take his life there: this if she perform, \\n She shall not sue unheard. So to them both. \\n \\n\\n \\n EUPHRONIUS \\n Fortune pursue thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Bring him through the bands. \\n Exit EUPHRONIUS \\n To THYREUS   To try eloquence, now 'tis time: dispatch; \\n From Antony win Cleopatra: promise, \\n And in our name, what she requires; add more, \\n From thine invention, offers: women are not \\n In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure \\n The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus; \\n Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we \\n Will answer as a law. \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n Caesar, I go. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, \\n And what thou think'st his very action speaks \\n In every power that moves. \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n Caesar, I shall. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE XIII.  Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What shall we do, Enobarbus? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Think, and die. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Is Antony or we in fault for this? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Antony only, that would make his will \\n Lord of his reason. What though you fled \\n From that great face of war, whose several ranges \\n Frighted each other? why should he follow? \\n The itch of his affection should not then \\n Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point, \\n When half to half the world opposed, he being \\n The meered question: 'twas a shame no less \\n Than was his loss, to course your flying flags, \\n And leave his navy gazing. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Prithee, peace. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Is that his answer? \\n \\n\\n \\n EUPHRONIUS \\n Ay, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n The queen shall then have courtesy, so she \\n Will yield us up. \\n \\n\\n \\n EUPHRONIUS \\n He says so. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Let her know't. \\n To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, \\n And he will fill thy wishes to the brim \\n With principalities. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n That head, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n To him again: tell him he wears the rose \\n Of youth upon him; from which the world should note \\n Something particular: his coin, ships, legions, \\n May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail \\n Under the service of a child as soon \\n As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore \\n To lay his gay comparisons apart, \\n And answer me declined, sword against sword, \\n Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside   Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will \\n Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show, \\n Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are \\n A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward \\n Do draw the inward quality after them, \\n To suffer all alike. That he should dream, \\n Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will \\n Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued \\n His judgment too. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter an Attendant \\n\\n \\n Attendant \\n A messenger from CAESAR. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What, no more ceremony? See, my women! \\n Against the blown rose may they stop their nose \\n That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Attendant \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside   Mine honesty and I begin to square. \\n The loyalty well held to fools does make \\n Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure \\n To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord \\n Does conquer him that did his master conquer \\n And earns a place i' the story. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter THYREUS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Caesar's will? \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n Hear it apart. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n None but friends: say boldly. \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n So, haply, are they friends to Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has; \\n Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master \\n Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know, \\n Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's. \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n So. \\n Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats, \\n Not to consider in what case thou stand'st, \\n Further than he is Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Go on: right royal. \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n He knows that you embrace not Antony \\n As you did love, but as you fear'd him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O! \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n The scars upon your honour, therefore, he \\n Does pity, as constrained blemishes, \\n Not as deserved. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n He is a god, and knows \\n What is most right: mine honour was not yielded, \\n But conquer'd merely. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside              To be sure of that, \\n I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky, \\n That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for \\n Thy dearest quit thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n Shall I say to Caesar \\n What you require of him? for he partly begs \\n To be desired to give. It much would please him, \\n That of his fortunes you should make a staff \\n To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits, \\n To hear from me you had left Antony, \\n And put yourself under his shrowd, \\n The universal landlord. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What's your name? \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n My name is Thyreus. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Most kind messenger, \\n Say to great Caesar this: in deputation \\n I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt \\n To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel: \\n Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear \\n The doom of Egypt. \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n 'Tis your noblest course. \\n Wisdom and fortune combating together, \\n If that the former dare but what it can, \\n No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay \\n My duty on your hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Your Caesar's father oft, \\n When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in, \\n Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place, \\n As it rain'd kisses. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Favours, by Jove that thunders! \\n What art thou, fellow? \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n One that but performs \\n The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest \\n To have command obey'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside                You will be whipp'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods \\n and devils! \\n Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!' \\n Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth, \\n And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am \\n Antony yet. \\n Enter Attendants \\n Take hence this Jack, and whip him. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside   'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp \\n Than with an old one dying. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Moon and stars! \\n Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries \\n That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them \\n So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name, \\n Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows, \\n Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face, \\n And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence. \\n \\n\\n \\n THYREUS \\n Mark Antony! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Tug him away: being whipp'd, \\n Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall \\n Bear us an errand to him. \\n Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS \\n You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha! \\n Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome, \\n Forborne the getting of a lawful race, \\n And by a gem of women, to be abused \\n By one that looks on feeders? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Good my lord,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n You have been a boggler ever: \\n But when we in our viciousness grow hard-- \\n O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes; \\n In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us \\n Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut \\n To our confusion. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O, is't come to this? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I found you as a morsel cold upon \\n Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment \\n Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours, \\n Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have \\n Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure, \\n Though you can guess what temperance should be, \\n You know not what it is. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Wherefore is this? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n To let a fellow that will take rewards \\n And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with \\n My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal \\n And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were \\n Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar \\n The horned herd! for I have savage cause; \\n And to proclaim it civilly, were like \\n A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank \\n For being yare about him. \\n Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS \\n Is he whipp'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Attendant \\n Soundly, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Attendant \\n He did ask favour. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n If that thy father live, let him repent \\n Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry \\n To follow Caesar in his triumph, since \\n Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth \\n The white hand of a lady fever thee, \\n Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar, \\n Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say \\n He makes me angry with him; for he seems \\n Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am, \\n Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry; \\n And at this time most easy 'tis to do't, \\n When my good stars, that were my former guides, \\n Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires \\n Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike \\n My speech and what is done, tell him he has \\n Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom \\n He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture, \\n As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou: \\n Hence with thy stripes, begone! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit THYREUS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Have you done yet? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Alack, our terrene moon \\n Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone \\n The fall of Antony! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I must stay his time. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes \\n With one that ties his points? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Not know me yet? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Cold-hearted toward me? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Ah, dear, if I be so, \\n From my cold heart let heaven engender hail, \\n And poison it in the source; and the first stone \\n Drop in my neck: as it determines, so \\n Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite! \\n Till by degrees the memory of my womb, \\n Together with my brave Egyptians all, \\n By the discandying of this pelleted storm, \\n Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile \\n Have buried them for prey! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I am satisfied. \\n Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where \\n I will oppose his fate. Our force by land \\n Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too \\n Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like. \\n Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady? \\n If from the field I shall return once more \\n To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood; \\n I and my sword will earn our chronicle: \\n There's hope in't yet. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n That's my brave lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed, \\n And fight maliciously: for when mine hours \\n Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives \\n Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth, \\n And send to darkness all that stop me. Come, \\n Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me \\n All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more; \\n Let's mock the midnight bell. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n It is my birth-day: \\n I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord \\n Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n We will yet do well. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Call all his noble captains to my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force \\n The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen; \\n There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight, \\n I'll make death love me; for I will contend \\n Even with his pestilent scythe. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious, \\n Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood \\n The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still, \\n A diminution in our captain's brain \\n Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason, \\n It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek \\n Some way to leave him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT IV \\n\\n SCENE I.  Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with\\nhis Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power \\n To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger \\n He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat, \\n Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know \\n I have many other ways to die; meantime \\n Laugh at his challenge. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n Caesar must think, \\n When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted \\n Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now \\n Make boot of his distraction: never anger \\n Made good guard for itself. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Let our best heads \\n Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles \\n We mean to fight: within our files there are, \\n Of those that served Mark Antony but late, \\n Enough to fetch him in. See it done: \\n And feast the army; we have store to do't, \\n And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Alexandria.

Woo't thou fight well? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.' \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Well said; come on. \\n Call forth my household servants: let's to-night \\n Be bounteous at our meal. \\n Enter three or four Servitors \\n Give me thy hand, \\n Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;-- \\n Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well, \\n And kings have been your fellows. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS   What means this? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside to CLEOPATRA   'Tis one of those odd \\n tricks which sorrow shoots \\n Out of the mind. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n And thou art honest too. \\n I wish I could be made so many men, \\n And all of you clapp'd up together in \\n An Antony, that I might do you service \\n So good as you have done. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n The gods forbid! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night: \\n Scant not my cups; and make as much of me \\n As when mine empire was your fellow too, \\n And suffer'd my command. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS   What does he mean? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Aside to CLEOPATRA   To make his followers weep. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Tend me to-night; \\n May be it is the period of your duty: \\n Haply you shall not see me more; or if, \\n A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow \\n You'll serve another master. I look on you \\n As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends, \\n I turn you not away; but, like a master \\n Married to your good service, stay till death: \\n Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more, \\n And the gods yield you for't! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n What mean you, sir, \\n To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep; \\n And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame, \\n Transform us not to women. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Ho, ho, ho! \\n Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus! \\n Grace grow where those drops fall! \\n My hearty friends, \\n You take me in too dolorous a sense; \\n For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you \\n To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts, \\n I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you \\n Where rather I'll expect victorious life \\n Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come, \\n And drown consideration. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  The same.

O love, \\n That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st \\n The royal occupation! thou shouldst see \\n A workman in't. \\n Enter an armed Soldier \\n Good morrow to thee; welcome: \\n Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge: \\n To business that we love we rise betime, \\n And go to't with delight. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n A thousand, sir, \\n Early though't be, have on their riveted trim, \\n And at the port expect you. \\n \\n\\n Shout.

O, my fortunes have \\n Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. \\n Flourish.

Canidius and the rest \\n That fell away have entertainment, but \\n No honourable trust. I have done ill; \\n Of which I do accuse myself so sorely, \\n That I will joy no more. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n Enobarbus, Antony \\n Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with \\n His bounty overplus: the messenger \\n Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now \\n Unloading of his mules. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I give it you. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soldier \\n Mock not, Enobarbus. \\n I tell you true: best you safed the bringer \\n Out of the host; I must attend mine office, \\n Or would have done't myself. Your emperor \\n Continues still a Jove. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n I am alone the villain of the earth, \\n And feel I am so most. O Antony, \\n Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid \\n My better service, when my turpitude \\n Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart: \\n If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean \\n Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel. \\n I fight against thee! No: I will go seek \\n Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits \\n My latter part of life. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE VII.  Field of battle between the camps. \\n Alarum. Drums and trumpets.

Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed! \\n Had we done so at first, we had droven them home \\n With clouts about their heads. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Thou bleed'st apace. \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n I had a wound here that was like a T, \\n But now 'tis made an H. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n They do retire. \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet \\n Room for six scotches more. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter EROS \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves \\n For a fair victory. \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n Let us score their backs, \\n And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind: \\n 'Tis sport to maul a runner. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I will reward thee \\n Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold \\n For thy good valour. Come thee on. \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n I'll halt after. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VIII.  Under the walls of Alexandria. \\n Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march; SCARUS,\\nwith others \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n We have beat him to his camp: run one before, \\n And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow, \\n Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood \\n That has to-day escaped. I thank you all; \\n For doughty-handed are you, and have fought \\n Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been \\n Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors. \\n Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends, \\n Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears \\n Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss \\n The honour'd gashes whole. \\n To SCARUS \\n Give me thy hand \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, attended \\n To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts, \\n Make her thanks bless thee. \\n To CLEOPATRA \\n O thou day o' the world, \\n Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all, \\n Through proof of harness to my heart, and there \\n Ride on the pants triumphing! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Lord of lords! \\n O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from \\n The world's great snare uncaught? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n My nightingale, \\n We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! \\n though grey \\n Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we \\n A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can \\n Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man; \\n Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand: \\n Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day \\n As if a god, in hate of mankind, had \\n Destroy'd in such a shape. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I'll give thee, friend, \\n An armour all of gold; it was a king's. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n He has deserved it, were it carbuncled \\n Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand: \\n Through Alexandria make a jolly march; \\n Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them: \\n Had our great palace the capacity \\n To camp this host, we all would sup together, \\n And drink carouses to the next day's fate, \\n Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters, \\n With brazen din blast you the city's ear; \\n Make mingle with rattling tabourines; \\n That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together, \\n Applauding our approach. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IX.  OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. \\n Sentinels at their post \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n If we be not relieved within this hour, \\n We must return to the court of guard: the night \\n Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle \\n By the second hour i' the morn. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Soldier \\n This last day was \\n A shrewd one to's. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n O, bear me witness, night,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Soldier \\n What man is this? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Soldier \\n Stand close, and list him. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon, \\n When men revolted shall upon record \\n Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did \\n Before thy face repent! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n Enobarbus! \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Soldier \\n Peace! \\n Hark further. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS \\n O sovereign mistress of true melancholy, \\n The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me, \\n That life, a very rebel to my will, \\n May hang no longer on me: throw my heart \\n Against the flint and hardness of my fault: \\n Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder, \\n And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony, \\n Nobler than my revolt is infamous, \\n Forgive me in thine own particular; \\n But let the world rank me in register \\n A master-leaver and a fugitive: \\n O Antony! O Antony! \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n Second Soldier \\n Let's speak To him. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n Let's hear him, for the things he speaks \\n May concern Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Soldier \\n Let's do so. But he sleeps. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his \\n Was never yet for sleep. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Soldier \\n Go we to him. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Soldier \\n Awake, sir, awake; speak to us. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Soldier \\n Hear you, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n The hand of death hath raught him. \\n Drums afar off \\n Hark! the drums \\n Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him \\n To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour \\n Is fully out. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Soldier \\n Come on, then; \\n He may recover yet. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt with the body \\n \\n\\n SCENE X.  Between the two camps. \\n Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS, with their Army \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Their preparation is to-day by sea; \\n We please them not by land. \\n \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n For both, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air; \\n We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot \\n Upon the hills adjoining to the city \\n Shall stay with us: order for sea is given; \\n They have put forth the haven \\n Where their appointment we may best discover, \\n And look on their endeavour. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE XI.  Another part of the same. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n But being charged, we will be still by land, \\n Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force \\n Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales, \\n And hold our best advantage. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE XII.  Another part of the same. \\n Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine \\n does stand, \\n I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word \\n Straight, how 'tis like to go. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n SCARUS \\n Swallows have built \\n In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers \\n Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly, \\n And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony \\n Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts, \\n His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear, \\n Of what he has, and has not. \\n \\n\\n Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight \\n Re-enter MARK ANTONY \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n All is lost; \\n This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me: \\n My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder \\n They cast their caps up and carouse together \\n Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! \\n 'tis thou \\n Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart \\n Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly; \\n For when I am revenged upon my charm, \\n I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone. \\n Exit SCARUS \\n O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more: \\n Fortune and Antony part here; even here \\n Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts \\n That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave \\n Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets \\n On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd, \\n That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am: \\n O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,-- \\n Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home; \\n Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,-- \\n Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose, \\n Beguiled me to the very heart of loss. \\n What, Eros, Eros! \\n Enter CLEOPATRA \\n Ah, thou spell! Avaunt! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Why is my lord enraged against his love? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, \\n And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee, \\n And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians: \\n Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot \\n Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown \\n For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let \\n Patient Octavia plough thy visage up \\n With her prepared nails. \\n Exit CLEOPATRA \\n 'Tis well thou'rt gone, \\n If it be well to live; but better 'twere \\n Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death \\n Might have prevented many. Eros, ho! \\n The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me, \\n Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage: \\n Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon; \\n And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club, \\n Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die: \\n To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall \\n Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE XIII.  Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Help me, my women! O, he is more mad \\n Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly \\n Was never so emboss'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n To the monument! \\n There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead. \\n The soul and body rive not more in parting \\n Than greatness going off. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n To the monument! \\n Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself; \\n Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,' \\n And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian, \\n And bring me how he takes my death. \\n To the monument! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE XIV.  The same. Another room. \\n Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Eros, thou yet behold'st me? \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Ay, noble lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish; \\n A vapour sometime like a bear or lion, \\n A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock, \\n A forked mountain, or blue promontory \\n With trees upon't, that nod unto the world, \\n And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen \\n these signs; \\n They are black vesper's pageants. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Ay, my lord, \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n That which is now a horse, even with a thought \\n The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct, \\n As water is in water. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n It does, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n My good knave Eros, now thy captain is \\n Even such a body: here I am Antony: \\n Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave. \\n I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,-- \\n Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine; \\n Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't \\n A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has \\n Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory \\n Unto an enemy's triumph. \\n Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us \\n Ourselves to end ourselves. \\n Enter MARDIAN \\n O! thy vile lady! \\n She has robb'd me of my sword. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARDIAN \\n No, Antony; \\n My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled \\n With thine entirely. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Hence, saucy eunuch; peace! \\n She hath betray'd me and shall die the death. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARDIAN \\n Death of one person can be paid but once, \\n And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do \\n Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake \\n Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!' \\n Then in the midst a tearing groan did break \\n The name of Antony; it was divided \\n Between her heart and lips: she render'd life, \\n Thy name so buried in her. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Dead, then? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARDIAN \\n Dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done, \\n And we must sleep. \\n To MARDIAN \\n That thou depart'st hence safe, \\n Does pay thy labour richly; go. \\n Exit MARDIAN \\n Off, pluck off: \\n The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep \\n The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides! \\n Heart, once be stronger than thy continent, \\n Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace. \\n No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go; \\n You have been nobly borne. From me awhile. \\n Exit EROS \\n I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and \\n Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now \\n All length is torture: since the torch is out, \\n Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour \\n Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles \\n Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done. \\n Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me: \\n Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand, \\n And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze: \\n Dido and her AEneas shall want troops, \\n And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros! \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter EROS \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n What would my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Since Cleopatra died, \\n I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods \\n Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword \\n Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back \\n With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack \\n The courage of a woman; less noble mind \\n Than she which by her death our Caesar tells \\n 'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros, \\n That, when the exigent should come, which now \\n Is come indeed, when I should see behind me \\n The inevitable prosecution of \\n Disgrace and horror, that, on my command, \\n Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come: \\n Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st. \\n Put colour in thy cheek. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n The gods withhold me! \\n Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, \\n Though enemy, lost aim, and could not? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Eros, \\n Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see \\n Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down \\n His corrigible neck, his face subdued \\n To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat \\n Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded \\n His baseness that ensued? \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n I would not see't. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured. \\n Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn \\n Most useful for thy country. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n O, sir, pardon me! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then \\n To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once; \\n Or thy precedent services are all \\n But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Turn from me, then, that noble countenance, \\n Wherein the worship of the whole world lies. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Lo thee! \\n \\n\\n\\n Turning from him \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n My sword is drawn. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Then let it do at once \\n The thing why thou hast drawn it. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n My dear master, \\n My captain, and my emperor, let me say, \\n Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n 'Tis said, man; and farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Now, Eros. \\n \\n\\n \\n EROS \\n Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow \\n Of Antony's death. \\n \\n\\n\\n Kills himself \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Thrice-nobler than myself! \\n Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what \\n I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros \\n Have by their brave instruction got upon me \\n A nobleness in record: but I will be \\n A bridegroom in my death, and run into't \\n As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros, \\n Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus \\n Falling on his sword \\n I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead? \\n The guard, ho! O, dispatch me! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DERCETAS and Guard \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n What's the noise? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end \\n Of what I have begun. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Guard \\n The star is fall'n. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n And time is at his period. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Alas, and woe! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Let him that loves me strike me dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n Not I. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Guard \\n Nor I. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Guard \\n Nor any one. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Guard \\n\\n \\n DERCETAS \\n Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly. \\n This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings, \\n Shall enter me with him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DIOMEDES \\n\\n \\n DIOMEDES \\n Where's Antony? \\n \\n\\n \\n DERCETAS \\n There, Diomed there. \\n \\n\\n \\n DIOMEDES \\n Lives he? \\n Wilt thou not answer, man? \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit DERCETAS \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me \\n Sufficing strokes for death. \\n \\n\\n \\n DIOMEDES \\n Most absolute lord, \\n My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n When did she send thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n DIOMEDES \\n Now, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Where is she? \\n \\n\\n \\n DIOMEDES \\n Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear \\n Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw-- \\n Which never shall be found--you did suspect \\n She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage \\n Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead; \\n But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent \\n Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come, \\n I dread, too late. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee. \\n \\n\\n \\n DIOMEDES \\n What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho! \\n Come, your lord calls! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides; \\n 'Tis the last service that I shall command you. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear \\n All your true followers out. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Most heavy day! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate \\n To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome \\n Which comes to punish us, and we punish it \\n Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up: \\n I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends, \\n And have my thanks for all. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY \\n \\n\\n SCENE XV.  The same. A monument. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with\\nCHARMIAN and IRAS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O Charmian, I will never go from hence. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Be comforted, dear madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n No, I will not: \\n All strange and terrible events are welcome, \\n But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow, \\n Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great \\n As that which makes it. \\n Enter, below, DIOMEDES \\n How now! is he dead? \\n \\n\\n \\n DIOMEDES \\n His death's upon him, but not dead. \\n Look out o' the other side your monument; \\n His guard have brought him thither. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O sun, \\n Burn the great sphere thou movest in! \\n darkling stand \\n The varying shore o' the world. O Antony, \\n Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help; \\n Help, friends below; let's draw him hither. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Peace! \\n Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony, \\n But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n So it should be, that none but Antony \\n Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I am dying, Egypt, dying; only \\n I here importune death awhile, until \\n Of many thousand kisses the poor last \\n I lay up thy lips. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I dare not, dear,-- \\n Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not, \\n Lest I be taken: not the imperious show \\n Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall \\n Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs, \\n serpents, have \\n Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe: \\n Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes \\n And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour \\n Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,-- \\n Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up: \\n Assist, good friends. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n O, quick, or I am gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord! \\n Our strength is all gone into heaviness, \\n That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power, \\n The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up, \\n And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,-- \\n Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come; \\n They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA \\n And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived: \\n Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power, \\n Thus would I wear them out. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n A heavy sight! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n I am dying, Egypt, dying: \\n Give me some wine, and let me speak a little. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n No, let me speak; and let me rail so high, \\n That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel, \\n Provoked by my offence. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n One word, sweet queen: \\n Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n They do not go together. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n Gentle, hear me: \\n None about Caesar trust but Proculeius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n My resolution and my hands I'll trust; \\n None about Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARK ANTONY \\n The miserable change now at my end \\n Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts \\n In feeding them with those my former fortunes \\n Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world, \\n The noblest; and do now not basely die, \\n Not cowardly put off my helmet to \\n My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman \\n Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going; \\n I can no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Noblest of men, woo't die? \\n Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide \\n In this dull world, which in thy absence is \\n No better than a sty? O, see, my women, \\n MARK ANTONY dies \\n The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord! \\n O, wither'd is the garland of the war, \\n The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls \\n Are level now with men; the odds is gone, \\n And there is nothing left remarkable \\n Beneath the visiting moon. \\n \\n\\n\\n Faints \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n O, quietness, lady! \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n She is dead too, our sovereign. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Lady! \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Madam! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n O madam, madam, madam! \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Royal Egypt, Empress! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Peace, peace, Iras! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded \\n By such poor passion as the maid that milks \\n And does the meanest chares. It were for me \\n To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods; \\n To tell them that this world did equal theirs \\n Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught; \\n Patience is scottish, and impatience does \\n Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin \\n To rush into the secret house of death, \\n Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women? \\n What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian! \\n My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look, \\n Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart: \\n We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, \\n what's noble, \\n Let's do it after the high Roman fashion, \\n And make death proud to take us. Come, away: \\n This case of that huge spirit now is cold: \\n Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend \\n But resolution, and the briefest end. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT V \\n\\n SCENE I.  Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS,\\nGALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield; \\n Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks \\n The pauses that he makes. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Caesar, I shall. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest \\n Appear thus to us? \\n \\n\\n \\n DERCETAS \\n I am call'd Dercetas; \\n Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy \\n Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke, \\n He was my master; and I wore my life \\n To spend upon his haters. If thou please \\n To take me to thee, as I was to him \\n I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not, \\n I yield thee up my life. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n What is't thou say'st? \\n \\n\\n \\n DERCETAS \\n I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n The breaking of so great a thing should make \\n A greater crack: the round world \\n Should have shook lions into civil streets, \\n And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony \\n Is not a single doom; in the name lay \\n A moiety of the world. \\n \\n\\n \\n DERCETAS \\n He is dead, Caesar: \\n Not by a public minister of justice, \\n Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand, \\n Which writ his honour in the acts it did, \\n Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it, \\n Splitted the heart. This is his sword; \\n I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd \\n With his most noble blood. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Look you sad, friends? \\n The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings \\n To wash the eyes of kings. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n And strange it is, \\n That nature must compel us to lament \\n Our most persisted deeds. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n His taints and honours \\n Waged equal with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n AGRIPPA \\n A rarer spirit never \\n Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us \\n Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MECAENAS \\n When such a spacious mirror's set before him, \\n He needs must see himself. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n O Antony! \\n I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance \\n Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce \\n Have shown to thee such a declining day, \\n Or look on thine; we could not stall together \\n In the whole world: but yet let me lament, \\n With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts, \\n That thou, my brother, my competitor \\n In top of all design, my mate in empire, \\n Friend and companion in the front of war, \\n The arm of mine own body, and the heart \\n Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars, \\n Unreconciliable, should divide \\n Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-- \\n But I will tell you at some meeter season: \\n Enter an Egyptian \\n The business of this man looks out of him; \\n We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you? \\n \\n\\n \\n Egyptian \\n A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress, \\n Confined in all she has, her monument, \\n Of thy intents desires instruction, \\n That she preparedly may frame herself \\n To the way she's forced to. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Bid her have good heart: \\n She soon shall know of us, by some of ours, \\n How honourable and how kindly we \\n Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live \\n To be ungentle. \\n \\n\\n \\n Egyptian \\n So the gods preserve thee! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say, \\n We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts \\n The quality of her passion shall require, \\n Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke \\n She do defeat us; for her life in Rome \\n Would be eternal in our triumph: go, \\n And with your speediest bring us what she says, \\n And how you find of her. \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n Caesar, I shall. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Gallus, go you along. \\n Exit GALLUS \\n Where's Dolabella, \\n To second Proculeius? \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Dolabella! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Let him alone, for I remember now \\n How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready. \\n Go with me to my tent; where you shall see \\n How hardly I was drawn into this war; \\n How calm and gentle I proceeded still \\n In all my writings: go with me, and see \\n What I can show in this. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Alexandria. A room in the monument. \\n Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n My desolation does begin to make \\n A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar; \\n Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave, \\n A minister of her will: and it is great \\n To do that thing that ends all other deeds; \\n Which shackles accidents and bolts up change; \\n Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug, \\n The beggar's nurse and Caesar's. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS,\\nGALLUS and Soldiers \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt; \\n And bids thee study on what fair demands \\n Thou mean'st to have him grant thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What's thy name? \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n My name is Proculeius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Antony \\n Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but \\n I do not greatly care to be deceived, \\n That have no use for trusting. If your master \\n Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, \\n That majesty, to keep decorum, must \\n No less beg than a kingdom: if he please \\n To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son, \\n He gives me so much of mine own, as I \\n Will kneel to him with thanks. \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n Be of good cheer; \\n You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing: \\n Make your full reference freely to my lord, \\n Who is so full of grace, that it flows over \\n On all that need: let me report to him \\n Your sweet dependency; and you shall find \\n A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness, \\n Where he for grace is kneel'd to. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Pray you, tell him \\n I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him \\n The greatness he has got. I hourly learn \\n A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly \\n Look him i' the face. \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n This I'll report, dear lady. \\n Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied \\n Of him that caused it. \\n \\n\\n \\n GALLUS \\n You see how easily she may be surprised: \\n Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the\\nmonument by a ladder placed against a window, and,\\nhaving descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of\\nthe Guard unbar and open the gates \\n To PROCULEIUS and the Guard \\n Guard her till Caesar come. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Royal queen! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen: \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Quick, quick, good hands. \\n \\n\\n\\n Drawing a dagger \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n Hold, worthy lady, hold: \\n Seizes and disarms her \\n Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this \\n Relieved, but not betray'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What, of death too, \\n That rids our dogs of languish? \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n Cleopatra, \\n Do not abuse my master's bounty by \\n The undoing of yourself: let the world see \\n His nobleness well acted, which your death \\n Will never let come forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Where art thou, death? \\n Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen \\n Worthy many babes and beggars! \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n O, temperance, lady! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir; \\n If idle talk will once be necessary, \\n I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin, \\n Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I \\n Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court; \\n Nor once be chastised with the sober eye \\n Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up \\n And show me to the shouting varletry \\n Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt \\n Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud \\n Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies \\n Blow me into abhorring! rather make \\n My country's high pyramides my gibbet, \\n And hang me up in chains! \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n You do extend \\n These thoughts of horror further than you shall \\n Find cause in Caesar. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DOLABELLA \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Proculeius, \\n What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, \\n And he hath sent for thee: for the queen, \\n I'll take her to my guard. \\n \\n\\n \\n PROCULEIUS \\n So, Dolabella, \\n It shall content me best: be gentle to her. \\n To CLEOPATRA \\n To Caesar I will speak what you shall please, \\n If you'll employ me to him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Say, I would die. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Most noble empress, you have heard of me? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I cannot tell. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Assuredly you know me. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n No matter, sir, what I have heard or known. \\n You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams; \\n Is't not your trick? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n I understand not, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony: \\n O, such another sleep, that I might see \\n But such another man! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n If it might please ye,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck \\n A sun and moon, which kept their course, \\n and lighted \\n The little O, the earth. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Most sovereign creature,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm \\n Crested the world: his voice was propertied \\n As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends; \\n But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, \\n He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty, \\n There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas \\n That grew the more by reaping: his delights \\n Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above \\n The element they lived in: in his livery \\n Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were \\n As plates dropp'd from his pocket. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Cleopatra! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Think you there was, or might be, such a man \\n As this I dream'd of? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Gentle madam, no. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. \\n But, if there be, or ever were, one such, \\n It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff \\n To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine \\n And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy, \\n Condemning shadows quite. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Hear me, good madam. \\n Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it \\n As answering to the weight: would I might never \\n O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel, \\n By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites \\n My very heart at root. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n I thank you, sir, \\n Know you what Caesar means to do with me? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n I am loath to tell you what I would you knew. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Nay, pray you, sir,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Though he be honourable,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n He'll lead me, then, in triumph? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Madam, he will; I know't. \\n \\n\\n Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there:\\nOctavius Caesar!' \\n Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS,\\nMECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Which is the Queen of Egypt? \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n It is the emperor, madam. \\n \\n\\n\\n CLEOPATRA kneels \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Arise, you shall not kneel: \\n I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Sir, the gods \\n Will have it thus; my master and my lord \\n I must obey. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Take to you no hard thoughts: \\n The record of what injuries you did us, \\n Though written in our flesh, we shall remember \\n As things but done by chance. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Sole sir o' the world, \\n I cannot project mine own cause so well \\n To make it clear; but do confess I have \\n Been laden with like frailties which before \\n Have often shamed our sex. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Cleopatra, know, \\n We will extenuate rather than enforce: \\n If you apply yourself to our intents, \\n Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find \\n A benefit in this change; but if you seek \\n To lay on me a cruelty, by taking \\n Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself \\n Of my good purposes, and put your children \\n To that destruction which I'll guard them from, \\n If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we, \\n Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall \\n Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels, \\n I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued; \\n Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus? \\n \\n\\n \\n SELEUCUS \\n Here, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord, \\n Upon his peril, that I have reserved \\n To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus. \\n \\n\\n \\n SELEUCUS \\n Madam, \\n I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril, \\n Speak that which is not. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n What have I kept back? \\n \\n\\n \\n SELEUCUS \\n Enough to purchase what you have made known. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve \\n Your wisdom in the deed. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n See, Caesar! O, behold, \\n How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours; \\n And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine. \\n The ingratitude of this Seleucus does \\n Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust \\n Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt \\n Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes, \\n Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog! \\n O rarely base! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Good queen, let us entreat you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this, \\n That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me, \\n Doing the honour of thy lordliness \\n To one so meek, that mine own servant should \\n Parcel the sum of my disgraces by \\n Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar, \\n That I some lady trifles have reserved, \\n Immoment toys, things of such dignity \\n As we greet modern friends withal; and say, \\n Some nobler token I have kept apart \\n For Livia and Octavia, to induce \\n Their mediation; must I be unfolded \\n With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me \\n Beneath the fall I have. \\n To SELEUCUS \\n Prithee, go hence; \\n Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits \\n Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man, \\n Thou wouldst have mercy on me. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Forbear, Seleucus. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit SELEUCUS \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought \\n For things that others do; and, when we fall, \\n We answer others' merits in our name, \\n Are therefore to be pitied. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Cleopatra, \\n Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged, \\n Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours, \\n Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe, \\n Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you \\n Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd; \\n Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen; \\n For we intend so to dispose you as \\n Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep: \\n Our care and pity is so much upon you, \\n That we remain your friend; and so, adieu. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n My master, and my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Not so. Adieu. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not \\n Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian. \\n \\n\\n\\n Whispers CHARMIAN \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n Finish, good lady; the bright day is done, \\n And we are for the dark. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Hie thee again: \\n I have spoke already, and it is provided; \\n Go put it to the haste. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Madam, I will. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter DOLABELLA \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Where is the queen? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Behold, sir. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Dolabella! \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Madam, as thereto sworn by your command, \\n Which my love makes religion to obey, \\n I tell you this: Caesar through Syria \\n Intends his journey; and within three days \\n You with your children will he send before: \\n Make your best use of this: I have perform'd \\n Your pleasure and my promise. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Dolabella, \\n I shall remain your debtor. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n I your servant, \\n Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Farewell, and thanks. \\n Exit DOLABELLA \\n Now, Iras, what think'st thou? \\n Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown \\n In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves \\n With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall \\n Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths, \\n Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded, \\n And forced to drink their vapour. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n The gods forbid! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors \\n Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers \\n Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians \\n Extemporally will stage us, and present \\n Our Alexandrian revels; Antony \\n Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see \\n Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness \\n I' the posture of a whore. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n O the good gods! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Nay, that's certain. \\n \\n\\n \\n IRAS \\n I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails \\n Are stronger than mine eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Why, that's the way \\n To fool their preparation, and to conquer \\n Their most absurd intents. \\n Re-enter CHARMIAN \\n Now, Charmian! \\n Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch \\n My best attires: I am again for Cydnus, \\n To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go. \\n Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed; \\n And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave \\n To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all. \\n Wherefore's this noise? \\n \\n\\n Exit IRAS. A noise within \\n Enter a Guardsman \\n\\n \\n Guard \\n Here is a rural fellow \\n That will not be denied your highness presence: \\n He brings you figs. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Let him come in. \\n Exit Guardsman \\n What poor an instrument \\n May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty. \\n My resolution's placed, and I have nothing \\n Of woman in me: now from head to foot \\n I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon \\n No planet is of mine. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket \\n\\n \\n Guard \\n This is the man. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Avoid, and leave him. \\n Exit Guardsman \\n Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, \\n That kills and pains not? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party \\n that should desire you to touch him, for his biting \\n is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or \\n never recover. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Rememberest thou any that have died on't? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of \\n them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, \\n but something given to lie; as a woman should not \\n do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the \\n biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes \\n a very good report o' the worm; but he that will \\n believe all that they say, shall never be saved by \\n half that they do: but this is most fallible, the \\n worm's an odd worm. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Get thee hence; farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n I wish you all joy of the worm. \\n \\n\\n\\n Setting down his basket \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n You must think this, look you, that the worm will \\n do his kind. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Ay, ay; farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the \\n keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no \\n goodness in worm. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Take thou no care; it shall be heeded. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is \\n not worth the feeding. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Will it eat me? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n You must not think I am so simple but I know the \\n devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a \\n woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her \\n not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the \\n gods great harm in their women; for in every ten \\n that they make, the devils mar five. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Well, get thee gone; farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, &c \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have \\n Immortal longings in me: now no more \\n The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip: \\n Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear \\n Antony call; I see him rouse himself \\n To praise my noble act; I hear him mock \\n The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men \\n To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come: \\n Now to that name my courage prove my title! \\n I am fire and air; my other elements \\n I give to baser life. So; have you done? \\n Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips. \\n Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell. \\n Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies \\n Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall? \\n If thou and nature can so gently part, \\n The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch, \\n Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still? \\n If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world \\n It is not worth leave-taking. \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say, \\n The gods themselves do weep! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n This proves me base: \\n If she first meet the curled Antony, \\n He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss \\n Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou \\n mortal wretch, \\n To an asp, which she applies to her breast \\n With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate \\n Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool \\n Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak, \\n That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass \\n Unpolicied! \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n O eastern star! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n Peace, peace! \\n Dost thou not see my baby at my breast, \\n That sucks the nurse asleep? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n O, break! O, break! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLEOPATRA \\n As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,-- \\n O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too. \\n Applying another asp to her arm \\n What should I stay-- \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n In this vile world? So, fare thee well. \\n Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies \\n A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close; \\n And golden Phoebus never be beheld \\n Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry; \\n I'll mend it, and then play. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter the Guard, rushing in \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n Where is the queen? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Speak softly, wake her not. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n Caesar hath sent-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n Too slow a messenger. \\n Applies an asp \\n O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Guard \\n There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n What work is here! Charmian, is this well done? \\n \\n\\n \\n CHARMIAN \\n It is well done, and fitting for a princess \\n Descended of so many royal kings. \\n Ah, soldier! \\n \\n\\n Dies \\n Re-enter DOLABELLA \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n How goes it here? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Guard \\n All dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Caesar, thy thoughts \\n Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming \\n To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou \\n So sought'st to hinder. \\n \\n\\n Within  'A way there, a way for Caesar!' \\n Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n O sir, you are too sure an augurer; \\n That you did fear is done. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Bravest at the last, \\n She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal, \\n Took her own way. The manner of their deaths? \\n I do not see them bleed. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Who was last with them? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n A simple countryman, that brought her figs: \\n This was his basket. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Poison'd, then. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n O Caesar, \\n This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake: \\n I found her trimming up the diadem \\n On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood \\n And on the sudden dropp'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n O noble weakness! \\n If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear \\n By external swelling: but she looks like sleep, \\n As she would catch another Antony \\n In her strong toil of grace. \\n \\n\\n \\n DOLABELLA \\n Here, on her breast, \\n There is a vent of blood and something blown: \\n The like is on her arm. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Guard \\n This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves \\n Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves \\n Upon the caves of Nile. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS CAESAR \\n Most probable \\n That so she died; for her physician tells me \\n She hath pursued conclusions infinite \\n Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed; \\n And bear her women from the monument: \\n She shall be buried by her Antony: \\n No grave upon the earth shall clip in it \\n A pair so famous. High events as these \\n Strike those that make them; and their story is \\n No less in pity than his glory which \\n Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall \\n In solemn show attend this funeral; \\n And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see \\n High order in this great solemnity. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n TITLE \\n\\n\\n\\n A Midsummer Night's Dream \\n\\n\\n\\n PERSONAE \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dramatis Personae \\n\\n THESEUS, Duke of Athens. \\n EGEUS, father to Hermia. \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n DEMETRIUS \\n in love with Hermia. \\n \\n\\n PHILOSTRATE, master of the revels to Theseus. \\n QUINCE, a carpenter. \\n SNUG, a joiner. \\n BOTTOM, a weaver. \\n FLUTE, a bellows-mender. \\n SNOUT, a tinker. \\n STARVELING, a tailor. \\n HIPPOLYTA, queen of the Amazons, betrothed to Theseus. \\n HERMIA, daughter to Egeus, in love with Lysander. \\n HELENA, in love with Demetrius. \\n OBERON, king of the fairies. \\n TITANIA, queen of the fairies. \\n PUCK, or Robin Goodfellow. \\n\\n \\n PEASEBLOSSOM \\n COBWEB \\n MOTH \\n MUSTARDSEED \\n fairies. \\n \\n\\n Other fairies attending their King and Queen. \\n Attendants on Theseus and Hippolyta. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n SCNDESCR \\n\\n\\n\\n SCENE  Athens, and a wood near it. \\n\\n\\n\\n PLAYSUBT \\n\\n\\n\\n A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT I \\n\\n SCENE I.  Athens. The palace of THESEUS. \\n Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and\\nAttendants \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour \\n Draws on apace; four happy days bring in \\n Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow \\n This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires, \\n Like to a step-dame or a dowager \\n Long withering out a young man revenue. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n Four days will quickly steep themselves in night; \\n Four nights will quickly dream away the time; \\n And then the moon, like to a silver bow \\n New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night \\n Of our solemnities. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Go, Philostrate, \\n Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; \\n Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; \\n Turn melancholy forth to funerals; \\n The pale companion is not for our pomp. \\n Exit PHILOSTRATE \\n Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword, \\n And won thy love, doing thee injuries; \\n But I will wed thee in another key, \\n With pomp, with triumph and with revelling. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS \\n\\n \\n EGEUS \\n Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke! \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n EGEUS \\n Full of vexation come I, with complaint \\n Against my child, my daughter Hermia. \\n Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord, \\n This man hath my consent to marry her. \\n Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke, \\n This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child; \\n Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, \\n And interchanged love-tokens with my child: \\n Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung, \\n With feigning voice verses of feigning love, \\n And stolen the impression of her fantasy \\n With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits, \\n Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers \\n Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth: \\n With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart, \\n Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me, \\n To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke, \\n Be it so she; will not here before your grace \\n Consent to marry with Demetrius, \\n I beg the ancient privilege of Athens, \\n As she is mine, I may dispose of her: \\n Which shall be either to this gentleman \\n Or to her death, according to our law \\n Immediately provided in that case. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid: \\n To you your father should be as a god; \\n One that composed your beauties, yea, and one \\n To whom you are but as a form in wax \\n By him imprinted and within his power \\n To leave the figure or disfigure it. \\n Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n So is Lysander. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n In himself he is; \\n But in this kind, wanting your father's voice, \\n The other must be held the worthier. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n I would my father look'd but with my eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Rather your eyes must with his judgment look. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n I do entreat your grace to pardon me. \\n I know not by what power I am made bold, \\n Nor how it may concern my modesty, \\n In such a presence here to plead my thoughts; \\n But I beseech your grace that I may know \\n The worst that may befall me in this case, \\n If I refuse to wed Demetrius. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Either to die the death or to abjure \\n For ever the society of men. \\n Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires; \\n Know of your youth, examine well your blood, \\n Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, \\n You can endure the livery of a nun, \\n For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd, \\n To live a barren sister all your life, \\n Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon. \\n Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood, \\n To undergo such maiden pilgrimage; \\n But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd, \\n Than that which withering on the virgin thorn \\n Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, \\n Ere I will my virgin patent up \\n Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke \\n My soul consents not to give sovereignty. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon-- \\n The sealing-day betwixt my love and me, \\n For everlasting bond of fellowship-- \\n Upon that day either prepare to die \\n For disobedience to your father's will, \\n Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would; \\n Or on Diana's altar to protest \\n For aye austerity and single life. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield \\n Thy crazed title to my certain right. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n You have her father's love, Demetrius; \\n Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him. \\n \\n\\n \\n EGEUS \\n Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love, \\n And what is mine my love shall render him. \\n And she is mine, and all my right of her \\n I do estate unto Demetrius. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n I am, my lord, as well derived as he, \\n As well possess'd; my love is more than his; \\n My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd, \\n If not with vantage, as Demetrius'; \\n And, which is more than all these boasts can be, \\n I am beloved of beauteous Hermia: \\n Why should not I then prosecute my right? \\n Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, \\n Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, \\n And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes, \\n Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, \\n Upon this spotted and inconstant man. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n I must confess that I have heard so much, \\n And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof; \\n But, being over-full of self-affairs, \\n My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come; \\n And come, Egeus; you shall go with me, \\n I have some private schooling for you both. \\n For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself \\n To fit your fancies to your father's will; \\n Or else the law of Athens yields you up-- \\n Which by no means we may extenuate-- \\n To death, or to a vow of single life. \\n Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love? \\n Demetrius and Egeus, go along: \\n I must employ you in some business \\n Against our nuptial and confer with you \\n Of something nearly that concerns yourselves. \\n \\n\\n \\n EGEUS \\n With duty and desire we follow you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale? \\n How chance the roses there do fade so fast? \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Belike for want of rain, which I could well \\n Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Ay me! for aught that I could ever read, \\n Could ever hear by tale or history, \\n The course of true love never did run smooth; \\n But, either it was different in blood,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Or else misgraffed in respect of years,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n O spite! too old to be engaged to young. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n O hell! to choose love by another's eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, \\n War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, \\n Making it momentany as a sound, \\n Swift as a shadow, short as any dream; \\n Brief as the lightning in the collied night, \\n That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth, \\n And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!' \\n The jaws of darkness do devour it up: \\n So quick bright things come to confusion. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n If then true lovers have been ever cross'd, \\n It stands as an edict in destiny: \\n Then let us teach our trial patience, \\n Because it is a customary cross, \\n As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, \\n Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia. \\n I have a widow aunt, a dowager \\n Of great revenue, and she hath no child: \\n From Athens is her house remote seven leagues; \\n And she respects me as her only son. \\n There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee; \\n And to that place the sharp Athenian law \\n Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then, \\n Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night; \\n And in the wood, a league without the town, \\n Where I did meet thee once with Helena, \\n To do observance to a morn of May, \\n There will I stay for thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n My good Lysander! \\n I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow, \\n By his best arrow with the golden head, \\n By the simplicity of Venus' doves, \\n By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, \\n And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen, \\n When the false Troyan under sail was seen, \\n By all the vows that ever men have broke, \\n In number more than ever women spoke, \\n In that same place thou hast appointed me, \\n To-morrow truly will I meet with thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HELENA \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n God speed fair Helena! whither away? \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Call you me fair? that fair again unsay. \\n Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair! \\n Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air \\n More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear, \\n When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. \\n Sickness is catching: O, were favour so, \\n Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go; \\n My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye, \\n My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody. \\n Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, \\n The rest I'd give to be to you translated. \\n O, teach me how you look, and with what art \\n You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n I frown upon him, yet he loves me still. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n I give him curses, yet he gives me love. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n O that my prayers could such affection move! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n The more I hate, the more he follows me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n The more I love, the more he hateth me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Take comfort: he no more shall see my face; \\n Lysander and myself will fly this place. \\n Before the time I did Lysander see, \\n Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me: \\n O, then, what graces in my love do dwell, \\n That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell! \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Helen, to you our minds we will unfold: \\n To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold \\n Her silver visage in the watery glass, \\n Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass, \\n A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal, \\n Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n And in the wood, where often you and I \\n Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie, \\n Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, \\n There my Lysander and myself shall meet; \\n And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, \\n To seek new friends and stranger companies. \\n Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us; \\n And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius! \\n Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight \\n From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n I will, my Hermia. \\n Exit HERMIA \\n Helena, adieu: \\n As you on him, Demetrius dote on you! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n How happy some o'er other some can be! \\n Through Athens I am thought as fair as she. \\n But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; \\n He will not know what all but he do know: \\n And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, \\n So I, admiring of his qualities: \\n Things base and vile, folding no quantity, \\n Love can transpose to form and dignity: \\n Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; \\n And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind: \\n Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste; \\n Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste: \\n And therefore is Love said to be a child, \\n Because in choice he is so oft beguiled. \\n As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, \\n So the boy Love is perjured every where: \\n For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne, \\n He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine; \\n And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, \\n So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt. \\n I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight: \\n Then to the wood will he to-morrow night \\n Pursue her; and for this intelligence \\n If I have thanks, it is a dear expense: \\n But herein mean I to enrich my pain, \\n To have his sight thither and back again. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Athens. QUINCE'S house. \\n Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and\\nSTARVELING \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Is all our company here? \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n You were best to call them generally, man by man, \\n according to the scrip. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is \\n thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our \\n interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his \\n wedding-day at night. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats \\n on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow \\n to a point. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and \\n most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a \\n merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your \\n actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n That will ask some tears in the true performing of \\n it: if I do it, let the audience look to their \\n eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some \\n measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a \\n tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to \\n tear a cat in, to make all split. \\n The raging rocks \\n And shivering shocks \\n Shall break the locks \\n Of prison gates; \\n And Phibbus' car \\n Shall shine from far \\n And make and mar \\n The foolish Fates. \\n This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. \\n This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is \\n more condoling. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Francis Flute, the bellows-mender. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n Here, Peter Quince. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Flute, you must take Thisby on you. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n What is Thisby? a wandering knight? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n It is the lady that Pyramus must love. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and \\n you may speak as small as you will. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll \\n speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne, \\n Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear, \\n and lady dear!' \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Well, proceed. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Robin Starveling, the tailor. \\n \\n\\n \\n STARVELING \\n Here, Peter Quince. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother. \\n Tom Snout, the tinker. \\n \\n\\n \\n SNOUT \\n Here, Peter Quince. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father: \\n Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I \\n hope, here is a play fitted. \\n \\n\\n \\n SNUG \\n Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it \\n be, give it me, for I am slow of study. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will \\n do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar, \\n that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again, \\n let him roar again.' \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n An you should do it too terribly, you would fright \\n the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; \\n and that were enough to hang us all. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n That would hang us, every mother's son. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the \\n ladies out of their wits, they would have no more \\n discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my \\n voice so that I will roar you as gently as any \\n sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any \\n nightingale. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a \\n sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a \\n summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man: \\n therefore you must needs play Pyramus. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best \\n to play it in? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Why, what you will. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I will discharge it in either your straw-colour \\n beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain \\n beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your \\n perfect yellow. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and \\n then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here \\n are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request \\n you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night; \\n and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the \\n town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if \\n we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with \\n company, and our devices known. In the meantime I \\n will draw a bill of properties, such as our play \\n wants. I pray you, fail me not. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n We will meet; and there we may rehearse most \\n obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n At the duke's oak we meet. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Enough; hold or cut bow-strings. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT II \\n\\n SCENE I.  A wood near Athens. \\n Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n How now, spirit! whither wander you? \\n \\n\\n \\n Fairy \\n Over hill, over dale, \\n Thorough bush, thorough brier, \\n Over park, over pale, \\n Thorough flood, thorough fire, \\n I do wander everywhere, \\n Swifter than the moon's sphere; \\n And I serve the fairy queen, \\n To dew her orbs upon the green. \\n The cowslips tall her pensioners be: \\n In their gold coats spots you see; \\n Those be rubies, fairy favours, \\n In those freckles live their savours: \\n I must go seek some dewdrops here \\n And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. \\n Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone: \\n Our queen and all our elves come here anon. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n The king doth keep his revels here to-night: \\n Take heed the queen come not within his sight; \\n For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, \\n Because that she as her attendant hath \\n A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king; \\n She never had so sweet a changeling; \\n And jealous Oberon would have the child \\n Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild; \\n But she perforce withholds the loved boy, \\n Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy: \\n And now they never meet in grove or green, \\n By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen, \\n But, they do square, that all their elves for fear \\n Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fairy \\n Either I mistake your shape and making quite, \\n Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite \\n Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he \\n That frights the maidens of the villagery; \\n Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern \\n And bootless make the breathless housewife churn; \\n And sometime make the drink to bear no barm; \\n Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm? \\n Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck, \\n You do their work, and they shall have good luck: \\n Are not you he? \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Thou speak'st aright; \\n I am that merry wanderer of the night. \\n I jest to Oberon and make him smile \\n When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, \\n Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: \\n And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, \\n In very likeness of a roasted crab, \\n And when she drinks, against her lips I bob \\n And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale. \\n The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, \\n Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; \\n Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, \\n And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough; \\n And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, \\n And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear \\n A merrier hour was never wasted there. \\n But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fairy \\n And here my mistress. Would that he were gone! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;\\nfrom the other, TITANIA, with hers \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence: \\n I have forsworn his bed and company. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Then I must be thy lady: but I know \\n When thou hast stolen away from fairy land, \\n And in the shape of Corin sat all day, \\n Playing on pipes of corn and versing love \\n To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here, \\n Come from the farthest Steppe of India? \\n But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, \\n Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love, \\n To Theseus must be wedded, and you come \\n To give their bed joy and prosperity. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, \\n Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, \\n Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? \\n Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night \\n From Perigenia, whom he ravished? \\n And make him with fair AEgle break his faith, \\n With Ariadne and Antiopa? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n These are the forgeries of jealousy: \\n And never, since the middle summer's spring, \\n Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead, \\n By paved fountain or by rushy brook, \\n Or in the beached margent of the sea, \\n To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, \\n But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport. \\n Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, \\n As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea \\n Contagious fogs; which falling in the land \\n Have every pelting river made so proud \\n That they have overborne their continents: \\n The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain, \\n The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn \\n Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard; \\n The fold stands empty in the drowned field, \\n And crows are fatted with the murrion flock; \\n The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud, \\n And the quaint mazes in the wanton green \\n For lack of tread are undistinguishable: \\n The human mortals want their winter here; \\n No night is now with hymn or carol blest: \\n Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, \\n Pale in her anger, washes all the air, \\n That rheumatic diseases do abound: \\n And thorough this distemperature we see \\n The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts \\n Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, \\n And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown \\n An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds \\n Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer, \\n The childing autumn, angry winter, change \\n Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world, \\n By their increase, now knows not which is which: \\n And this same progeny of evils comes \\n From our debate, from our dissension; \\n We are their parents and original. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Do you amend it then; it lies in you: \\n Why should Titania cross her Oberon? \\n I do but beg a little changeling boy, \\n To be my henchman. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Set your heart at rest: \\n The fairy land buys not the child of me. \\n His mother was a votaress of my order: \\n And, in the spiced Indian air, by night, \\n Full often hath she gossip'd by my side, \\n And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands, \\n Marking the embarked traders on the flood, \\n When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive \\n And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind; \\n Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait \\n Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,-- \\n Would imitate, and sail upon the land, \\n To fetch me trifles, and return again, \\n As from a voyage, rich with merchandise. \\n But she, being mortal, of that boy did die; \\n And for her sake do I rear up her boy, \\n And for her sake I will not part with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n How long within this wood intend you stay? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day. \\n If you will patiently dance in our round \\n And see our moonlight revels, go with us; \\n If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Give me that boy, and I will go with thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away! \\n We shall chide downright, if I longer stay. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit TITANIA with her train \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove \\n Till I torment thee for this injury. \\n My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest \\n Since once I sat upon a promontory, \\n And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back \\n Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath \\n That the rude sea grew civil at her song \\n And certain stars shot madly from their spheres, \\n To hear the sea-maid's music. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n I remember. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n That very time I saw, but thou couldst not, \\n Flying between the cold moon and the earth, \\n Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took \\n At a fair vestal throned by the west, \\n And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow, \\n As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts; \\n But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft \\n Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon, \\n And the imperial votaress passed on, \\n In maiden meditation, fancy-free. \\n Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell: \\n It fell upon a little western flower, \\n Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound, \\n And maidens call it love-in-idleness. \\n Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once: \\n The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid \\n Will make or man or woman madly dote \\n Upon the next live creature that it sees. \\n Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again \\n Ere the leviathan can swim a league. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n I'll put a girdle round about the earth \\n In forty minutes. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Having once this juice, \\n I'll watch Titania when she is asleep, \\n And drop the liquor of it in her eyes. \\n The next thing then she waking looks upon, \\n Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, \\n On meddling monkey, or on busy ape, \\n She shall pursue it with the soul of love: \\n And ere I take this charm from off her sight, \\n As I can take it with another herb, \\n I'll make her render up her page to me. \\n But who comes here? I am invisible; \\n And I will overhear their conference. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I love thee not, therefore pursue me not. \\n Where is Lysander and fair Hermia? \\n The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me. \\n Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood; \\n And here am I, and wode within this wood, \\n Because I cannot meet my Hermia. \\n Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant; \\n But yet you draw not iron, for my heart \\n Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw, \\n And I shall have no power to follow you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Do I entice you? do I speak you fair? \\n Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth \\n Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you? \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n And even for that do I love you the more. \\n I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius, \\n The more you beat me, I will fawn on you: \\n Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me, \\n Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave, \\n Unworthy as I am, to follow you. \\n What worser place can I beg in your love,-- \\n And yet a place of high respect with me,-- \\n Than to be used as you use your dog? \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit; \\n For I am sick when I do look on thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n And I am sick when I look not on you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n You do impeach your modesty too much, \\n To leave the city and commit yourself \\n Into the hands of one that loves you not; \\n To trust the opportunity of night \\n And the ill counsel of a desert place \\n With the rich worth of your virginity. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Your virtue is my privilege: for that \\n It is not night when I do see your face, \\n Therefore I think I am not in the night; \\n Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, \\n For you in my respect are all the world: \\n Then how can it be said I am alone, \\n When all the world is here to look on me? \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, \\n And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n The wildest hath not such a heart as you. \\n Run when you will, the story shall be changed: \\n Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase; \\n The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind \\n Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed, \\n When cowardice pursues and valour flies. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I will not stay thy questions; let me go: \\n Or, if thou follow me, do not believe \\n But I shall do thee mischief in the wood. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, \\n You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius! \\n Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex: \\n We cannot fight for love, as men may do; \\n We should be wood and were not made to woo. \\n Exit DEMETRIUS \\n I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell, \\n To die upon the hand I love so well. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove, \\n Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love. \\n Re-enter PUCK \\n Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Ay, there it is. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n I pray thee, give it me. \\n I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, \\n Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, \\n Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, \\n With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine: \\n There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, \\n Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight; \\n And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, \\n Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in: \\n And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, \\n And make her full of hateful fantasies. \\n Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove: \\n A sweet Athenian lady is in love \\n With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes; \\n But do it when the next thing he espies \\n May be the lady: thou shalt know the man \\n By the Athenian garments he hath on. \\n Effect it with some care, that he may prove \\n More fond on her than she upon her love: \\n And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Another part of the wood. \\n Enter TITANIA, with her train \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Come, now a roundel and a fairy song; \\n Then, for the third part of a minute, hence; \\n Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds, \\n Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings, \\n To make my small elves coats, and some keep back \\n The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders \\n At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep; \\n Then to your offices and let me rest. \\n The Fairies sing \\n You spotted snakes with double tongue, \\n Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen; \\n Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong, \\n Come not near our fairy queen. \\n Philomel, with melody \\n Sing in our sweet lullaby; \\n Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby: \\n Never harm, \\n Nor spell nor charm, \\n Come our lovely lady nigh; \\n So, good night, with lullaby. \\n Weaving spiders, come not here; \\n Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence! \\n Beetles black, approach not near; \\n Worm nor snail, do no offence. \\n Philomel, with melody, &c. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fairy \\n Hence, away! now all is well: \\n One aloof stand sentinel. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps \\n Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n What thou seest when thou dost wake, \\n Do it for thy true-love take, \\n Love and languish for his sake: \\n Be it ounce, or cat, or bear, \\n Pard, or boar with bristled hair, \\n In thy eye that shall appear \\n When thou wakest, it is thy dear: \\n Wake when some vile thing is near. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood; \\n And to speak troth, I have forgot our way: \\n We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good, \\n And tarry for the comfort of the day. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed; \\n For I upon this bank will rest my head. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n One turf shall serve as pillow for us both; \\n One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear, \\n Lie further off yet, do not lie so near. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence! \\n Love takes the meaning in love's conference. \\n I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit \\n So that but one heart we can make of it; \\n Two bosoms interchained with an oath; \\n So then two bosoms and a single troth. \\n Then by your side no bed-room me deny; \\n For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Lysander riddles very prettily: \\n Now much beshrew my manners and my pride, \\n If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied. \\n But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy \\n Lie further off; in human modesty, \\n Such separation as may well be said \\n Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, \\n So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend: \\n Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end! \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I; \\n And then end life when I end loyalty! \\n Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd! \\n \\n\\n They sleep \\n Enter PUCK \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Through the forest have I gone. \\n But Athenian found I none, \\n On whose eyes I might approve \\n This flower's force in stirring love. \\n Night and silence.--Who is here? \\n Weeds of Athens he doth wear: \\n This is he, my master said, \\n Despised the Athenian maid; \\n And here the maiden, sleeping sound, \\n On the dank and dirty ground. \\n Pretty soul! she durst not lie \\n Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy. \\n Churl, upon thy eyes I throw \\n All the power this charm doth owe. \\n When thou wakest, let love forbid \\n Sleep his seat on thy eyelid: \\n So awake when I am gone; \\n For I must now to Oberon. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n O, I am out of breath in this fond chase! \\n The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace. \\n Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies; \\n For she hath blessed and attractive eyes. \\n How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears: \\n If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers. \\n No, no, I am as ugly as a bear; \\n For beasts that meet me run away for fear: \\n Therefore no marvel though Demetrius \\n Do, as a monster fly my presence thus. \\n What wicked and dissembling glass of mine \\n Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne? \\n But who is here? Lysander! on the ground! \\n Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound. \\n Lysander if you live, good sir, awake. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Awaking   And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake. \\n Transparent Helena! Nature shows art, \\n That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart. \\n Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word \\n Is that vile name to perish on my sword! \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Do not say so, Lysander; say not so \\n What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though? \\n Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Content with Hermia! No; I do repent \\n The tedious minutes I with her have spent. \\n Not Hermia but Helena I love: \\n Who will not change a raven for a dove? \\n The will of man is by his reason sway'd; \\n And reason says you are the worthier maid. \\n Things growing are not ripe until their season \\n So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason; \\n And touching now the point of human skill, \\n Reason becomes the marshal to my will \\n And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook \\n Love's stories written in love's richest book. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born? \\n When at your hands did I deserve this scorn? \\n Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, \\n That I did never, no, nor never can, \\n Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, \\n But you must flout my insufficiency? \\n Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, \\n In such disdainful manner me to woo. \\n But fare you well: perforce I must confess \\n I thought you lord of more true gentleness. \\n O, that a lady, of one man refused. \\n Should of another therefore be abused! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there: \\n And never mayst thou come Lysander near! \\n For as a surfeit of the sweetest things \\n The deepest loathing to the stomach brings, \\n Or as tie heresies that men do leave \\n Are hated most of those they did deceive, \\n So thou, my surfeit and my heresy, \\n Of all be hated, but the most of me! \\n And, all my powers, address your love and might \\n To honour Helen and to be her knight! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Awaking   Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best \\n To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast! \\n Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here! \\n Lysander, look how I do quake with fear: \\n Methought a serpent eat my heart away, \\n And you sat smiling at his cruel pray. \\n Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord! \\n What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word? \\n Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear; \\n Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear. \\n No? then I well perceive you all not nigh \\n Either death or you I'll find immediately. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.

How answer you that? \\n \\n\\n \\n SNOUT \\n By'r lakin, a parlous fear. \\n \\n\\n \\n STARVELING \\n I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. \\n Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to \\n say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that \\n Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more \\n better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not \\n Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them \\n out of fear. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be \\n written in eight and six. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight. \\n \\n\\n \\n SNOUT \\n Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion? \\n \\n\\n \\n STARVELING \\n I fear it, I promise you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to \\n bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a \\n most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful \\n wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to \\n look to 't. \\n \\n\\n \\n SNOUT \\n Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must \\n be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself \\n must speak through, saying thus, or to the same \\n defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish \\n You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would \\n entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life \\n for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it \\n were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a \\n man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name \\n his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things; \\n that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, \\n you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight. \\n \\n\\n \\n SNOUT \\n Doth the moon shine that night we play our play? \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find \\n out moonshine, find out moonshine. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Yes, it doth shine that night. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Why, then may you leave a casement of the great \\n chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon \\n may shine in at the casement. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns \\n and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to \\n present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is \\n another thing: we must have a wall in the great \\n chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did \\n talk through the chink of a wall. \\n \\n\\n \\n SNOUT \\n You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom? \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Some man or other must present Wall: and let him \\n have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast \\n about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his \\n fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus \\n and Thisby whisper. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, \\n every mother's son, and rehearse your parts. \\n Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your \\n speech, enter into that brake: and so every one \\n according to his cue. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter PUCK behind \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here, \\n So near the cradle of the fairy queen? \\n What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor; \\n An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Odours, odours. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n --odours savours sweet: \\n So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear. \\n But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile, \\n And by and by I will to thee appear. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n Must I speak now? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes \\n but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, \\n Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, \\n Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew, \\n As true as truest horse that yet would never tire, \\n I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n 'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that \\n yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your \\n part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue \\n is past; it is, 'never tire.' \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would \\n never tire. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray, \\n masters! fly, masters! Help! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round, \\n Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier: \\n Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound, \\n A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire; \\n And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, \\n Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to \\n make me afeard. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter SNOUT \\n\\n \\n SNOUT \\n O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do \\n you? \\n \\n\\n Exit SNOUT \\n Re-enter QUINCE \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art \\n translated. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; \\n to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir \\n from this place, do what they can: I will walk up \\n and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear \\n I am not afraid. \\n Sings \\n The ousel cock so black of hue, \\n With orange-tawny bill, \\n The throstle with his note so true, \\n The wren with little quill,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Awaking   What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Sings \\n The finch, the sparrow and the lark, \\n The plain-song cuckoo gray, \\n Whose note full many a man doth mark, \\n And dares not answer nay;-- \\n for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish \\n a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry \\n 'cuckoo' never so? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again: \\n Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note; \\n So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape; \\n And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me \\n On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason \\n for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and \\n love keep little company together now-a-days; the \\n more the pity that some honest neighbours will not \\n make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out \\n of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Out of this wood do not desire to go: \\n Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no. \\n I am a spirit of no common rate; \\n The summer still doth tend upon my state; \\n And I do love thee: therefore, go with me; \\n I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee, \\n And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, \\n And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep; \\n And I will purge thy mortal grossness so \\n That thou shalt like an airy spirit go. \\n Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED \\n\\n \\n PEASEBLOSSOM \\n Ready. \\n \\n\\n \\n COBWEB \\n And I. \\n \\n\\n \\n MOTH \\n And I. \\n \\n\\n \\n MUSTARDSEED \\n And I. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Where shall we go? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Be kind and courteous to this gentleman; \\n Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes; \\n Feed him with apricocks and dewberries, \\n With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries; \\n The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees, \\n And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs \\n And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes, \\n To have my love to bed and to arise; \\n And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies \\n To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes: \\n Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies. \\n \\n\\n \\n PEASEBLOSSOM \\n Hail, mortal! \\n \\n\\n \\n COBWEB \\n Hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n MOTH \\n Hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n MUSTARDSEED \\n Hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your \\n worship's name. \\n \\n\\n \\n COBWEB \\n Cobweb. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master \\n Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with \\n you. Your name, honest gentleman? \\n \\n\\n \\n PEASEBLOSSOM \\n Peaseblossom. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your \\n mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good \\n Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more \\n acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n MUSTARDSEED \\n Mustardseed. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well: \\n that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath \\n devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise \\n you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I \\n desire your more acquaintance, good Master \\n Mustardseed. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower. \\n The moon methinks looks with a watery eye; \\n And when she weeps, weeps every little flower, \\n Lamenting some enforced chastity. \\n Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Another part of the wood. \\n Enter OBERON \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n I wonder if Titania be awaked; \\n Then, what it was that next came in her eye, \\n Which she must dote on in extremity. \\n Enter PUCK \\n Here comes my messenger. \\n How now, mad spirit! \\n What night-rule now about this haunted grove? \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n My mistress with a monster is in love. \\n Near to her close and consecrated bower, \\n While she was in her dull and sleeping hour, \\n A crew of patches, rude mechanicals, \\n That work for bread upon Athenian stalls, \\n Were met together to rehearse a play \\n Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day. \\n The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, \\n Who Pyramus presented, in their sport \\n Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake \\n When I did him at this advantage take, \\n An ass's nole I fixed on his head: \\n Anon his Thisbe must be answered, \\n And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy, \\n As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye, \\n Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort, \\n Rising and cawing at the gun's report, \\n Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky, \\n So, at his sight, away his fellows fly; \\n And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls; \\n He murder cries and help from Athens calls. \\n Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears \\n thus strong, \\n Made senseless things begin to do them wrong; \\n For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch; \\n Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all \\n things catch. \\n I led them on in this distracted fear, \\n And left sweet Pyramus translated there: \\n When in that moment, so it came to pass, \\n Titania waked and straightway loved an ass. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n This falls out better than I could devise. \\n But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes \\n With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do? \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,-- \\n And the Athenian woman by his side: \\n That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Stand close: this is the same Athenian. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n This is the woman, but not this the man. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n O, why rebuke you him that loves you so? \\n Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse, \\n For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse, \\n If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, \\n Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, \\n And kill me too. \\n The sun was not so true unto the day \\n As he to me: would he have stolen away \\n From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon \\n This whole earth may be bored and that the moon \\n May through the centre creep and so displease \\n Her brother's noontide with Antipodes. \\n It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him; \\n So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n So should the murder'd look, and so should I, \\n Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty: \\n Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, \\n As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n What's this to my Lysander? where is he? \\n Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me? \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I had rather give his carcass to my hounds. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds \\n Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then? \\n Henceforth be never number'd among men! \\n O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake! \\n Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake, \\n And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch! \\n Could not a worm, an adder, do so much? \\n An adder did it; for with doubler tongue \\n Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n You spend your passion on a misprised mood: \\n I am not guilty of Lysander's blood; \\n Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n I pray thee, tell me then that he is well. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n An if I could, what should I get therefore? \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n A privilege never to see me more. \\n And from thy hated presence part I so: \\n See me no more, whether he be dead or no. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n There is no following her in this fierce vein: \\n Here therefore for a while I will remain. \\n So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow \\n For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe: \\n Which now in some slight measure it will pay, \\n If for his tender here I make some stay. \\n \\n\\n\\n Lies down and sleeps \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite \\n And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight: \\n Of thy misprision must perforce ensue \\n Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth, \\n A million fail, confounding oath on oath. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n About the wood go swifter than the wind, \\n And Helena of Athens look thou find: \\n All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer, \\n With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear: \\n By some illusion see thou bring her here: \\n I'll charm his eyes against she do appear. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n I go, I go; look how I go, \\n Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Flower of this purple dye, \\n Hit with Cupid's archery, \\n Sink in apple of his eye. \\n When his love he doth espy, \\n Let her shine as gloriously \\n As the Venus of the sky. \\n When thou wakest, if she be by, \\n Beg of her for remedy. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter PUCK \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Captain of our fairy band, \\n Helena is here at hand; \\n And the youth, mistook by me, \\n Pleading for a lover's fee. \\n Shall we their fond pageant see? \\n Lord, what fools these mortals be! \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Stand aside: the noise they make \\n Will cause Demetrius to awake. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Then will two at once woo one; \\n That must needs be sport alone; \\n And those things do best please me \\n That befal preposterously. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LYSANDER and HELENA \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Why should you think that I should woo in scorn? \\n Scorn and derision never come in tears: \\n Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born, \\n In their nativity all truth appears. \\n How can these things in me seem scorn to you, \\n Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true? \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n You do advance your cunning more and more. \\n When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray! \\n These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er? \\n Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh: \\n Your vows to her and me, put in two scales, \\n Will even weigh, and both as light as tales. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n I had no judgment when to her I swore. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Awaking   O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine! \\n To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne? \\n Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show \\n Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow! \\n That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow, \\n Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow \\n When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss \\n This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss! \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent \\n To set against me for your merriment: \\n If you we re civil and knew courtesy, \\n You would not do me thus much injury. \\n Can you not hate me, as I know you do, \\n But you must join in souls to mock me too? \\n If you were men, as men you are in show, \\n You would not use a gentle lady so; \\n To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts, \\n When I am sure you hate me with your hearts. \\n You both are rivals, and love Hermia; \\n And now both rivals, to mock Helena: \\n A trim exploit, a manly enterprise, \\n To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes \\n With your derision! none of noble sort \\n Would so offend a virgin, and extort \\n A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so; \\n For you love Hermia; this you know I know: \\n And here, with all good will, with all my heart, \\n In Hermia's love I yield you up my part; \\n And yours of Helena to me bequeath, \\n Whom I do love and will do till my death. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Never did mockers waste more idle breath. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none: \\n If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone. \\n My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd, \\n And now to Helen is it home return'd, \\n There to remain. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Helen, it is not so. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, \\n Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear. \\n Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter HERMIA \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, \\n The ear more quick of apprehension makes; \\n Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense, \\n It pays the hearing double recompense. \\n Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found; \\n Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound \\n But why unkindly didst thou leave me so? \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go? \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n What love could press Lysander from my side? \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Lysander's love, that would not let him bide, \\n Fair Helena, who more engilds the night \\n Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light. \\n Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know, \\n The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so? \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n You speak not as you think: it cannot be. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Lo, she is one of this confederacy! \\n Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three \\n To fashion this false sport, in spite of me. \\n Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid! \\n Have you conspired, have you with these contrived \\n To bait me with this foul derision? \\n Is all the counsel that we two have shared, \\n The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, \\n When we have chid the hasty-footed time \\n For parting us,--O, is it all forgot? \\n All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence? \\n We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, \\n Have with our needles created both one flower, \\n Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, \\n Both warbling of one song, both in one key, \\n As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds, \\n Had been incorporate. So we grow together, \\n Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, \\n But yet an union in partition; \\n Two lovely berries moulded on one stem; \\n So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart; \\n Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, \\n Due but to one and crowned with one crest. \\n And will you rent our ancient love asunder, \\n To join with men in scorning your poor friend? \\n It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly: \\n Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, \\n Though I alone do feel the injury. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n I am amazed at your passionate words. \\n I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, \\n To follow me and praise my eyes and face? \\n And made your other love, Demetrius, \\n Who even but now did spurn me with his foot, \\n To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare, \\n Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this \\n To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander \\n Deny your love, so rich within his soul, \\n And tender me, forsooth, affection, \\n But by your setting on, by your consent? \\n What thought I be not so in grace as you, \\n So hung upon with love, so fortunate, \\n But miserable most, to love unloved? \\n This you should pity rather than despise. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERNIA \\n I understand not what you mean by this. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks, \\n Make mouths upon me when I turn my back; \\n Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up: \\n This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled. \\n If you have any pity, grace, or manners, \\n You would not make me such an argument. \\n But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault; \\n Which death or absence soon shall remedy. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse: \\n My love, my life my soul, fair Helena! \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n O excellent! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Sweet, do not scorn her so. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n If she cannot entreat, I can compel. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Thou canst compel no more than she entreat: \\n Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers. \\n Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do: \\n I swear by that which I will lose for thee, \\n To prove him false that says I love thee not. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I say I love thee more than he can do. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Quick, come! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Lysander, whereto tends all this? \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Away, you Ethiope! \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n No, no; he'll \\n Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow, \\n But yet come not: you are a tame man, go! \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose, \\n Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Why are you grown so rude? what change is this? \\n Sweet love,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out! \\n Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Do you not jest? \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Yes, sooth; and so do you. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n I would I had your bond, for I perceive \\n A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead? \\n Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n What, can you do me greater harm than hate? \\n Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love! \\n Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander? \\n I am as fair now as I was erewhile. \\n Since night you loved me; yet since night you left \\n me: \\n Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!-- \\n In earnest, shall I say? \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Ay, by my life; \\n And never did desire to see thee more. \\n Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt; \\n Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest \\n That I do hate thee and love Helena. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom! \\n You thief of love! what, have you come by night \\n And stolen my love's heart from him? \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Fine, i'faith! \\n Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, \\n No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear \\n Impatient answers from my gentle tongue? \\n Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you! \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game. \\n Now I perceive that she hath made compare \\n Between our statures; she hath urged her height; \\n And with her personage, her tall personage, \\n Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him. \\n And are you grown so high in his esteem; \\n Because I am so dwarfish and so low? \\n How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak; \\n How low am I? I am not yet so low \\n But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, \\n Let her not hurt me: I was never curst; \\n I have no gift at all in shrewishness; \\n I am a right maid for my cowardice: \\n Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think, \\n Because she is something lower than myself, \\n That I can match her. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Lower! hark, again. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me. \\n I evermore did love you, Hermia, \\n Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you; \\n Save that, in love unto Demetrius, \\n I told him of your stealth unto this wood. \\n He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him; \\n But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me \\n To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too: \\n And now, so you will let me quiet go, \\n To Athens will I bear my folly back \\n And follow you no further: let me go: \\n You see how simple and how fond I am. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you? \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n A foolish heart, that I leave here behind. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n What, with Lysander? \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n With Demetrius. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd! \\n She was a vixen when she went to school; \\n And though she be but little, she is fierce. \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n 'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'! \\n Why will you suffer her to flout me thus? \\n Let me come to her. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Get you gone, you dwarf; \\n You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made; \\n You bead, you acorn. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n You are too officious \\n In her behalf that scorns your services. \\n Let her alone: speak not of Helena; \\n Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend \\n Never so little show of love to her, \\n Thou shalt aby it. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Now she holds me not; \\n Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, \\n Of thine or mine, is most in Helena. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you: \\n Nay, go not back. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n I will not trust you, I, \\n Nor longer stay in your curst company. \\n Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray, \\n My legs are longer though, to run away. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n I am amazed, and know not what to say. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest, \\n Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook. \\n Did not you tell me I should know the man \\n By the Athenian garment be had on? \\n And so far blameless proves my enterprise, \\n That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes; \\n And so far am I glad it so did sort \\n As this their jangling I esteem a sport. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight: \\n Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; \\n The starry welkin cover thou anon \\n With drooping fog as black as Acheron, \\n And lead these testy rivals so astray \\n As one come not within another's way. \\n Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, \\n Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong; \\n And sometime rail thou like Demetrius; \\n And from each other look thou lead them thus, \\n Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep \\n With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep: \\n Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye; \\n Whose liquor hath this virtuous property, \\n To take from thence all error with his might, \\n And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight. \\n When they next wake, all this derision \\n Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision, \\n And back to Athens shall the lovers wend, \\n With league whose date till death shall never end. \\n Whiles I in this affair do thee employ, \\n I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy; \\n And then I will her charmed eye release \\n From monster's view, and all things shall be peace. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n My fairy lord, this must be done with haste, \\n For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast, \\n And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger; \\n At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there, \\n Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all, \\n That in crossways and floods have burial, \\n Already to their wormy beds are gone; \\n For fear lest day should look their shames upon, \\n They willfully themselves exile from light \\n And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n But we are spirits of another sort: \\n I with the morning's love have oft made sport, \\n And, like a forester, the groves may tread, \\n Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red, \\n Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams, \\n Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams. \\n But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay: \\n We may effect this business yet ere day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Up and down, up and down, \\n I will lead them up and down: \\n I am fear'd in field and town: \\n Goblin, lead them up and down. \\n Here comes one. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter LYSANDER \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Here, villain; drawn and ready.

Come, recreant; come, thou child; \\n I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled \\n That draws a sword on thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Yea, art thou there? \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt \\n Re-enter LYSANDER \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n He goes before me and still dares me on: \\n When I come where he calls, then he is gone. \\n The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I: \\n I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly; \\n That fallen am I in dark uneven way, \\n And here will rest me. \\n Lies down \\n Come, thou gentle day! \\n For if but once thou show me thy grey light, \\n I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite. \\n \\n\\n Sleeps \\n Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not? \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot \\n Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place, \\n And darest not stand, nor look me in the face. \\n Where art thou now? \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Come hither: I am here. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear, \\n If ever I thy face by daylight see: \\n Now, go thy way.

Where's Mounsieur Cobweb? \\n \\n\\n \\n COBWEB \\n Ready. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your \\n weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped \\n humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good \\n mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret \\n yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and, \\n good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; \\n I would be loath to have you overflown with a \\n honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed? \\n \\n\\n \\n MUSTARDSEED \\n Ready. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you, \\n leave your courtesy, good mounsieur. \\n \\n\\n \\n MUSTARDSEED \\n What's your Will? \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb \\n to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for \\n methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I \\n am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, \\n I must scratch. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n What, wilt thou hear some music, \\n my sweet love? \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have \\n the tongs and the bones. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good \\n dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle \\n of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n I have a venturous fairy that shall seek \\n The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. \\n But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I \\n have an exposition of sleep come upon me. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms. \\n Fairies, begone, and be all ways away. \\n Exeunt fairies \\n So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle \\n Gently entwist; the female ivy so \\n Enrings the barky fingers of the elm. \\n O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee! \\n \\n\\n They sleep \\n Enter PUCK \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Advancing   Welcome, good Robin. \\n See'st thou this sweet sight? \\n Her dotage now I do begin to pity: \\n For, meeting her of late behind the wood, \\n Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool, \\n I did upbraid her and fall out with her; \\n For she his hairy temples then had rounded \\n With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers; \\n And that same dew, which sometime on the buds \\n Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls, \\n Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes \\n Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail. \\n When I had at my pleasure taunted her \\n And she in mild terms begg'd my patience, \\n I then did ask of her her changeling child; \\n Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent \\n To bear him to my bower in fairy land. \\n And now I have the boy, I will undo \\n This hateful imperfection of her eyes: \\n And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp \\n From off the head of this Athenian swain; \\n That, he awaking when the other do, \\n May all to Athens back again repair \\n And think no more of this night's accidents \\n But as the fierce vexation of a dream. \\n But first I will release the fairy queen. \\n Be as thou wast wont to be; \\n See as thou wast wont to see: \\n Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower \\n Hath such force and blessed power. \\n Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n My Oberon! what visions have I seen! \\n Methought I was enamour'd of an ass. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n There lies your love. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n How came these things to pass? \\n O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now! \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head. \\n Titania, music call; and strike more dead \\n Than common sleep of all these five the sense. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep! \\n \\n\\n\\n Music, still \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Now, when thou wakest, with thine \\n own fool's eyes peep. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me, \\n And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be. \\n Now thou and I are new in amity, \\n And will to-morrow midnight solemnly \\n Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly, \\n And bless it to all fair prosperity: \\n There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be \\n Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Fairy king, attend, and mark: \\n I do hear the morning lark. \\n \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Then, my queen, in silence sad, \\n Trip we after the night's shade: \\n We the globe can compass soon, \\n Swifter than the wandering moon. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n Come, my lord, and in our flight \\n Tell me how it came this night \\n That I sleeping here was found \\n With these mortals on the ground. \\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n Horns winded within \\n Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Go, one of you, find out the forester; \\n For now our observation is perform'd; \\n And since we have the vaward of the day, \\n My love shall hear the music of my hounds. \\n Uncouple in the western valley; let them go: \\n Dispatch, I say, and find the forester. \\n Exit an Attendant \\n We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top, \\n And mark the musical confusion \\n Of hounds and echo in conjunction. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, \\n When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear \\n With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear \\n Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves, \\n The skies, the fountains, every region near \\n Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard \\n So musical a discord, such sweet thunder. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, \\n So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung \\n With ears that sweep away the morning dew; \\n Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls; \\n Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells, \\n Each under each. A cry more tuneable \\n Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn, \\n In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly: \\n Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these? \\n \\n\\n \\n EGEUS \\n My lord, this is my daughter here asleep; \\n And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is; \\n This Helena, old Nedar's Helena: \\n I wonder of their being here together. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n No doubt they rose up early to observe \\n The rite of May, and hearing our intent, \\n Came here in grace our solemnity. \\n But speak, Egeus; is not this the day \\n That Hermia should give answer of her choice? \\n \\n\\n \\n EGEUS \\n It is, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns. \\n Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS,\\nHELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up \\n Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past: \\n Begin these wood-birds but to couple now? \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Pardon, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n I pray you all, stand up. \\n I know you two are rival enemies: \\n How comes this gentle concord in the world, \\n That hatred is so far from jealousy, \\n To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity? \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n My lord, I shall reply amazedly, \\n Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear, \\n I cannot truly say how I came here; \\n But, as I think,--for truly would I speak, \\n And now do I bethink me, so it is,-- \\n I came with Hermia hither: our intent \\n Was to be gone from Athens, where we might, \\n Without the peril of the Athenian law. \\n \\n\\n \\n EGEUS \\n Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough: \\n I beg the law, the law, upon his head. \\n They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius, \\n Thereby to have defeated you and me, \\n You of your wife and me of my consent, \\n Of my consent that she should be your wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, \\n Of this their purpose hither to this wood; \\n And I in fury hither follow'd them, \\n Fair Helena in fancy following me. \\n But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,-- \\n But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia, \\n Melted as the snow, seems to me now \\n As the remembrance of an idle gaud \\n Which in my childhood I did dote upon; \\n And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, \\n The object and the pleasure of mine eye, \\n Is only Helena. To her, my lord, \\n Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia: \\n But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food; \\n But, as in health, come to my natural taste, \\n Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, \\n And will for evermore be true to it. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Fair lovers, you are fortunately met: \\n Of this discourse we more will hear anon. \\n Egeus, I will overbear your will; \\n For in the temple by and by with us \\n These couples shall eternally be knit: \\n And, for the morning now is something worn, \\n Our purposed hunting shall be set aside. \\n Away with us to Athens; three and three, \\n We'll hold a feast in great solemnity. \\n Come, Hippolyta. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n These things seem small and undistinguishable, \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Methinks I see these things with parted eye, \\n When every thing seems double. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n So methinks: \\n And I have found Demetrius like a jewel, \\n Mine own, and not mine own. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Are you sure \\n That we are awake? It seems to me \\n That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think \\n The duke was here, and bid us follow him? \\n \\n\\n \\n HERMIA \\n Yea; and my father. \\n \\n\\n \\n HELENA \\n And Hippolyta. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n And he did bid us follow to the temple. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him \\n And by the way let us recount our dreams. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Awaking   When my cue comes, call me, and I will \\n answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho! \\n Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout, \\n the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen \\n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare \\n vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to \\n say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go \\n about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there \\n is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and \\n methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if \\n he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye \\n of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not \\n seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue \\n to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream \\n was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of \\n this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, \\n because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the \\n latter end of a play, before the duke: \\n peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall \\n sing it at her death. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.

Out of doubt he is \\n transported. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes \\n not forward, doth it? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n It is not possible: you have not a man in all \\n Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft \\n man in Athens. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Yea and the best person too; and he is a very \\n paramour for a sweet voice. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us, \\n a thing of naught. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter SNUG \\n\\n \\n SNUG \\n Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and \\n there is two or three lords and ladies more married: \\n if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made \\n men. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLUTE \\n O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a \\n day during his life; he could not have 'scaped \\n sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him \\n sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged; \\n he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in \\n Pyramus, or nothing. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BOTTOM \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Where are these lads? where are these hearts? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUINCE \\n Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour! \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not \\n what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian.

All that I will tell you is, that \\n the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, \\n good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your \\n pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look \\n o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our \\n play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have \\n clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion \\n pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the \\n lion's claws.

Is there no play, \\n To ease the anguish of a torturing hour? \\n Call Philostrate. \\n \\n\\n \\n PHILOSTRATE \\n Here, mighty Theseus. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Say, what abridgement have you for this evening? \\n What masque? what music? How shall we beguile \\n The lazy time, if not with some delight? \\n \\n\\n \\n PHILOSTRATE \\n There is a brief how many sports are ripe: \\n Make choice of which your highness will see first. \\n \\n\\n\\n Giving a paper \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Reads   'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung \\n By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.' \\n We'll none of that: that have I told my love, \\n In glory of my kinsman Hercules. \\n Reads \\n 'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals, \\n Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.' \\n That is an old device; and it was play'd \\n When I from Thebes came last a conqueror. \\n Reads \\n 'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death \\n Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.' \\n That is some satire, keen and critical, \\n Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony. \\n Reads \\n 'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus \\n And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.' \\n Merry and tragical! tedious and brief! \\n That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow. \\n How shall we find the concord of this discord? \\n \\n\\n \\n PHILOSTRATE \\n A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, \\n Which is as brief as I have known a play; \\n But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, \\n Which makes it tedious; for in all the play \\n There is not one word apt, one player fitted: \\n And tragical, my noble lord, it is; \\n For Pyramus therein doth kill himself. \\n Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, \\n Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears \\n The passion of loud laughter never shed. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n What are they that do play it? \\n \\n\\n \\n PHILOSTRATE \\n Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, \\n Which never labour'd in their minds till now, \\n And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories \\n With this same play, against your nuptial. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n And we will hear it. \\n \\n\\n \\n PHILOSTRATE \\n No, my noble lord; \\n It is not for you: I have heard it over, \\n And it is nothing, nothing in the world; \\n Unless you can find sport in their intents, \\n Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain, \\n To do you service. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n I will hear that play; \\n For never anything can be amiss, \\n When simpleness and duty tender it. \\n Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit PHILOSTRATE \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged \\n And duty in his service perishing. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n He says they can do nothing in this kind. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing. \\n Our sport shall be to take what they mistake: \\n And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect \\n Takes it in might, not merit. \\n Where I have come, great clerks have purposed \\n To greet me with premeditated welcomes; \\n Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, \\n Make periods in the midst of sentences, \\n Throttle their practised accent in their fears \\n And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, \\n Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet, \\n Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome; \\n And in the modesty of fearful duty \\n I read as much as from the rattling tongue \\n Of saucy and audacious eloquence. \\n Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity \\n In least speak most, to my capacity. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter PHILOSTRATE \\n\\n \\n PHILOSTRATE \\n So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Let him approach. \\n \\n\\n Flourish of trumpets \\n Enter QUINCE for the Prologue \\n\\n \\n Prologue \\n If we offend, it is with our good will. \\n That you should think, we come not to offend, \\n But with good will. To show our simple skill, \\n That is the true beginning of our end. \\n Consider then we come but in despite. \\n We do not come as minding to contest you, \\n Our true intent is. All for your delight \\n We are not here. That you should here repent you, \\n The actors are at hand and by their show \\n You shall know all that you are like to know. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n This fellow doth not stand upon points. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows \\n not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not \\n enough to speak, but to speak true. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child \\n on a recorder; a sound, but not in government. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing \\n impaired, but all disordered. Who is next? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion \\n\\n \\n Prologue \\n Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show; \\n But wonder on, till truth make all things plain. \\n This man is Pyramus, if you would know; \\n This beauteous lady Thisby is certain. \\n This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present \\n Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder; \\n And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content \\n To whisper. At the which let no man wonder. \\n This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn, \\n Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know, \\n By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn \\n To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo. \\n This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name, \\n The trusty Thisby, coming first by night, \\n Did scare away, or rather did affright; \\n And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall, \\n Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain. \\n Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall, \\n And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain: \\n Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade, \\n He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast; \\n And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade, \\n His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest, \\n Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain \\n At large discourse, while here they do remain. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n I wonder if the lion be to speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do. \\n \\n\\n \\n Wall \\n In this same interlude it doth befall \\n That I, one Snout by name, present a wall; \\n And such a wall, as I would have you think, \\n That had in it a crannied hole or chink, \\n Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby, \\n Did whisper often very secretly. \\n This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show \\n That I am that same wall; the truth is so: \\n And this the cranny is, right and sinister, \\n Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Would you desire lime and hair to speak better? \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard \\n discourse, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Pyramus \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Pyramus draws near the wall: silence! \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black! \\n O night, which ever art when day is not! \\n O night, O night! alack, alack, alack, \\n I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot! \\n And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall, \\n That stand'st between her father's ground and mine! \\n Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall, \\n Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne! \\n Wall holds up his fingers \\n Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this! \\n But what see I? No Thisby do I see. \\n O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss! \\n Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me! \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again. \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me' \\n is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to \\n spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will \\n fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Thisbe \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans, \\n For parting my fair Pyramus and me! \\n My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones, \\n Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n I see a voice: now will I to the chink, \\n To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby! \\n \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n My love thou art, my love I think. \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace; \\n And, like Limander, am I trusty still. \\n \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill. \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true. \\n \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall! \\n \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all. \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway? \\n \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n 'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe \\n\\n \\n Wall \\n Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so; \\n And, being done, thus Wall away doth go. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Now is the mural down between the two neighbours. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear \\n without warning. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst \\n are no worse, if imagination amend them. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n It must be your imagination then, and not theirs. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n If we imagine no worse of them than they of \\n themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here \\n come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Lion and Moonshine \\n\\n \\n Lion \\n You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear \\n The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, \\n May now perchance both quake and tremble here, \\n When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar. \\n Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am \\n A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam; \\n For, if I should as lion come in strife \\n Into this place, 'twere pity on my life. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n A very gentle beast, of a good conscience. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n This lion is a very fox for his valour. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n True; and a goose for his discretion. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his \\n discretion; and the fox carries the goose. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; \\n for the goose carries not the fox. It is well: \\n leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon. \\n \\n\\n \\n Moonshine \\n This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;-- \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n He should have worn the horns on his head. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n He is no crescent, and his horns are \\n invisible within the circumference. \\n \\n\\n \\n Moonshine \\n This lanthorn doth the horned moon present; \\n Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man \\n should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the \\n man i' the moon? \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n He dares not come there for the candle; for, you \\n see, it is already in snuff. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n I am aweary of this moon: would he would change! \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n It appears, by his small light of discretion, that \\n he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all \\n reason, we must stay the time. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Proceed, Moon. \\n \\n\\n \\n Moonshine \\n All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the \\n lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this \\n thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all \\n these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Thisbe \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love? \\n \\n\\n \\n Lion \\n Roaring   Oh-- \\n \\n\\n\\n Thisbe runs off \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Well roared, Lion. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Well run, Thisbe. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a \\n good grace. \\n \\n\\n\\n The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Well moused, Lion. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n And so the lion vanished. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n And then came Pyramus. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Pyramus \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams; \\n I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright; \\n For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams, \\n I trust to take of truest Thisby sight. \\n But stay, O spite! \\n But mark, poor knight, \\n What dreadful dole is here! \\n Eyes, do you see? \\n How can it be? \\n O dainty duck! O dear! \\n Thy mantle good, \\n What, stain'd with blood! \\n Approach, ye Furies fell! \\n O Fates, come, come, \\n Cut thread and thrum; \\n Quail, crush, conclude, and quell! \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would \\n go near to make a man look sad. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man. \\n \\n\\n \\n Pyramus \\n O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame? \\n Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear: \\n Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame \\n That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd \\n with cheer. \\n Come, tears, confound; \\n Out, sword, and wound \\n The pap of Pyramus; \\n Ay, that left pap, \\n Where heart doth hop: \\n Stabs himself \\n Thus die I, thus, thus, thus. \\n Now am I dead, \\n Now am I fled; \\n My soul is in the sky: \\n Tongue, lose thy light; \\n Moon take thy flight: \\n Exit Moonshine \\n Now die, die, die, die, die. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing. \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and \\n prove an ass. \\n \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes \\n back and finds her lover? \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and \\n her passion ends the play. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter Thisbe \\n\\n \\n HIPPOLYTA \\n Methinks she should not use a long one for such a \\n Pyramus: I hope she will be brief. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which \\n Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us; \\n she for a woman, God bless us. \\n \\n\\n \\n LYSANDER \\n She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n And thus she means, videlicet:-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Thisbe \\n Asleep, my love? \\n What, dead, my dove? \\n O Pyramus, arise! \\n Speak, speak. Quite dumb? \\n Dead, dead? A tomb \\n Must cover thy sweet eyes. \\n These My lips, \\n This cherry nose, \\n These yellow cowslip cheeks, \\n Are gone, are gone: \\n Lovers, make moan: \\n His eyes were green as leeks. \\n O Sisters Three, \\n Come, come to me, \\n With hands as pale as milk; \\n Lay them in gore, \\n Since you have shore \\n With shears his thread of silk. \\n Tongue, not a word: \\n Come, trusty sword; \\n Come, blade, my breast imbrue: \\n Stabs herself \\n And, farewell, friends; \\n Thus Thisby ends: \\n Adieu, adieu, adieu. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n DEMETRIUS \\n Ay, and Wall too. \\n \\n\\n \\n BOTTOM \\n Starting up   No assure you; the wall is down that \\n parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the \\n epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two \\n of our company? \\n \\n\\n \\n THESEUS \\n No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no \\n excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all \\n dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he \\n that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself \\n in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine \\n tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably \\n discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your \\n epilogue alone. \\n A dance \\n The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve: \\n Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time. \\n I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn \\n As much as we this night have overwatch'd. \\n This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled \\n The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed. \\n A fortnight hold we this solemnity, \\n In nightly revels and new jollity. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt \\n Enter PUCK \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n Now the hungry lion roars, \\n And the wolf behowls the moon; \\n Whilst the heavy ploughman snores, \\n All with weary task fordone. \\n Now the wasted brands do glow, \\n Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud, \\n Puts the wretch that lies in woe \\n In remembrance of a shroud. \\n Now it is the time of night \\n That the graves all gaping wide, \\n Every one lets forth his sprite, \\n In the church-way paths to glide: \\n And we fairies, that do run \\n By the triple Hecate's team, \\n From the presence of the sun, \\n Following darkness like a dream, \\n Now are frolic: not a mouse \\n Shall disturb this hallow'd house: \\n I am sent with broom before, \\n To sweep the dust behind the door. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Through the house give gathering light, \\n By the dead and drowsy fire: \\n Every elf and fairy sprite \\n Hop as light as bird from brier; \\n And this ditty, after me, \\n Sing, and dance it trippingly. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITANIA \\n First, rehearse your song by rote \\n To each word a warbling note: \\n Hand in hand, with fairy grace, \\n Will we sing, and bless this place. \\n \\n\\n\\n Song and dance \\n\\n \\n OBERON \\n Now, until the break of day, \\n Through this house each fairy stray. \\n To the best bride-bed will we, \\n Which by us shall blessed be; \\n And the issue there create \\n Ever shall be fortunate. \\n So shall all the couples three \\n Ever true in loving be; \\n And the blots of Nature's hand \\n Shall not in their issue stand; \\n Never mole, hare lip, nor scar, \\n Nor mark prodigious, such as are \\n Despised in nativity, \\n Shall upon their children be. \\n With this field-dew consecrate, \\n Every fairy take his gait; \\n And each several chamber bless, \\n Through this palace, with sweet peace; \\n And the owner of it blest \\n Ever shall in safety rest. \\n Trip away; make no stay; \\n Meet me all by break of day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train \\n\\n \\n PUCK \\n If we shadows have offended, \\n Think but this, and all is mended, \\n That you have but slumber'd here \\n While these visions did appear. \\n And this weak and idle theme, \\n No more yielding but a dream, \\n Gentles, do not reprehend: \\n if you pardon, we will mend: \\n And, as I am an honest Puck, \\n If we have unearned luck \\n Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, \\n We will make amends ere long; \\n Else the Puck a liar call; \\n So, good night unto you all. \\n Give me your hands, if we be friends, \\n And Robin shall restore amends. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n TITLE \\n\\n\\n\\n The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark \\n\\n\\n\\n PERSONAE \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dramatis Personae \\n\\n CLAUDIUS, king of Denmark.  \\n HAMLET, son to the late, and nephew to the present king. \\n POLONIUS, lord chamberlain.  \\n HORATIO, friend to Hamlet. \\n LAERTES, son to Polonius. \\n LUCIANUS, nephew to the king. \\n\\n \\n VOLTIMAND \\n CORNELIUS \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n OSRIC \\n courtiers. \\n \\n\\n A Gentleman \\n A Priest.  \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n BERNARDO \\n officers. \\n \\n\\n FRANCISCO, a soldier. \\n REYNALDO, servant to Polonius. \\n Players. \\n Two Clowns, grave-diggers. \\n FORTINBRAS, prince of Norway.  \\n A Captain. \\n English Ambassadors.  \\n GERTRUDE, queen of Denmark, and mother to Hamlet.  \\n OPHELIA, daughter to Polonius. \\n Lords, Ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, and other Attendants. \\n Ghost of Hamlet's Father.  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n SCNDESCR \\n\\n\\n\\n SCENE  Denmark. \\n\\n\\n\\n PLAYSUBT \\n\\n\\n\\n HAMLET \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT I \\n\\n SCENE I.

I charge thee, speak! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Ghost \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n 'Tis gone, and will not answer. \\n \\n\\n \\n BERNARDO \\n How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale: \\n Is not this something more than fantasy? \\n What think you on't? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Before my God, I might not this believe \\n Without the sensible and true avouch \\n Of mine own eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Is it not like the king? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n As thou art to thyself: \\n Such was the very armour he had on \\n When he the ambitious Norway combated; \\n So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle, \\n He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. \\n 'Tis strange. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, \\n With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n In what particular thought to work I know not; \\n But in the gross and scope of my opinion, \\n This bodes some strange eruption to our state. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, \\n Why this same strict and most observant watch \\n So nightly toils the subject of the land, \\n And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, \\n And foreign mart for implements of war; \\n Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task \\n Does not divide the Sunday from the week; \\n What might be toward, that this sweaty haste \\n Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: \\n Who is't that can inform me? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n That can I; \\n At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, \\n Whose image even but now appear'd to us, \\n Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, \\n Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, \\n Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet-- \\n For so this side of our known world esteem'd him-- \\n Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact, \\n Well ratified by law and heraldry, \\n Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands \\n Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: \\n Against the which, a moiety competent \\n Was gaged by our king; which had return'd \\n To the inheritance of Fortinbras, \\n Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, \\n And carriage of the article design'd, \\n His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, \\n Of unimproved mettle hot and full, \\n Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there \\n Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, \\n For food and diet, to some enterprise \\n That hath a stomach in't; which is no other-- \\n As it doth well appear unto our state-- \\n But to recover of us, by strong hand \\n And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands \\n So by his father lost: and this, I take it, \\n Is the main motive of our preparations, \\n The source of this our watch and the chief head \\n Of this post-haste and romage in the land. \\n \\n\\n \\n BERNARDO \\n I think it be no other but e'en so: \\n Well may it sort that this portentous figure \\n Comes armed through our watch; so like the king \\n That was and is the question of these wars. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. \\n In the most high and palmy state of Rome, \\n A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, \\n The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead \\n Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: \\n As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, \\n Disasters in the sun; and the moist star \\n Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands \\n Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: \\n And even the like precurse of fierce events, \\n As harbingers preceding still the fates \\n And prologue to the omen coming on, \\n Have heaven and earth together demonstrated \\n Unto our climatures and countrymen.-- \\n But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again! \\n Re-enter Ghost \\n I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! \\n If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, \\n Speak to me: \\n If there be any good thing to be done, \\n That may to thee do ease and grace to me, \\n Speak to me: \\n Cock crows \\n If thou art privy to thy country's fate, \\n Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! \\n Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life \\n Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, \\n For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, \\n Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Shall I strike at it with my partisan? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Do, if it will not stand. \\n \\n\\n \\n BERNARDO \\n 'Tis here! \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n 'Tis here! \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n 'Tis gone! \\n Exit Ghost \\n We do it wrong, being so majestical, \\n To offer it the show of violence; \\n For it is, as the air, invulnerable, \\n And our vain blows malicious mockery. \\n \\n\\n \\n BERNARDO \\n It was about to speak, when the cock crew. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n And then it started like a guilty thing \\n Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, \\n The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, \\n Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat \\n Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, \\n Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, \\n The extravagant and erring spirit hies \\n To his confine: and of the truth herein \\n This present object made probation. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n It faded on the crowing of the cock. \\n Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes \\n Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, \\n The bird of dawning singeth all night long: \\n And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad; \\n The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, \\n No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, \\n So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n So have I heard and do in part believe it. \\n But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, \\n Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill: \\n Break we our watch up; and by my advice, \\n Let us impart what we have seen to-night \\n Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, \\n This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. \\n Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, \\n As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know \\n Where we shall find him most conveniently. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A room of state in the castle. \\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,\\nPOLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,\\nand Attendants \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death \\n The memory be green, and that it us befitted \\n To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom \\n To be contracted in one brow of woe, \\n Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature \\n That we with wisest sorrow think on him, \\n Together with remembrance of ourselves. \\n Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, \\n The imperial jointress to this warlike state, \\n Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,-- \\n With an auspicious and a dropping eye, \\n With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, \\n In equal scale weighing delight and dole,-- \\n Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd \\n Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone \\n With this affair along. For all, our thanks. \\n Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, \\n Holding a weak supposal of our worth, \\n Or thinking by our late dear brother's death \\n Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, \\n Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, \\n He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, \\n Importing the surrender of those lands \\n Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, \\n To our most valiant brother. So much for him. \\n Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: \\n Thus much the business is: we have here writ \\n To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,-- \\n Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears \\n Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress \\n His further gait herein; in that the levies, \\n The lists and full proportions, are all made \\n Out of his subject: and we here dispatch \\n You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, \\n For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; \\n Giving to you no further personal power \\n To business with the king, more than the scope \\n Of these delated articles allow. \\n Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. \\n \\n\\n \\n CORNELIUS \\n VOLTIMAND \\n In that and all things will we show our duty. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. \\n Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS \\n And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? \\n You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes? \\n You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, \\n And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, \\n That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? \\n The head is not more native to the heart, \\n The hand more instrumental to the mouth, \\n Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. \\n What wouldst thou have, Laertes? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n My dread lord, \\n Your leave and favour to return to France; \\n From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, \\n To show my duty in your coronation, \\n Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, \\n My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France \\n And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave \\n By laboursome petition, and at last \\n Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent: \\n I do beseech you, give him leave to go. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, \\n And thy best graces spend it at thy will! \\n But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Aside   A little more than kin, and less than kind. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n How is it that the clouds still hang on you? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, \\n And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. \\n Do not for ever with thy vailed lids \\n Seek for thy noble father in the dust: \\n Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die, \\n Passing through nature to eternity. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, madam, it is common. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n If it be, \\n Why seems it so particular with thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.' \\n 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, \\n Nor customary suits of solemn black, \\n Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, \\n No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, \\n Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, \\n Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, \\n That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, \\n For they are actions that a man might play: \\n But I have that within which passeth show; \\n These but the trappings and the suits of woe. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, \\n To give these mourning duties to your father: \\n But, you must know, your father lost a father; \\n That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound \\n In filial obligation for some term \\n To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever \\n In obstinate condolement is a course \\n Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief; \\n It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, \\n A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, \\n An understanding simple and unschool'd: \\n For what we know must be and is as common \\n As any the most vulgar thing to sense, \\n Why should we in our peevish opposition \\n Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, \\n A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, \\n To reason most absurd: whose common theme \\n Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, \\n From the first corse till he that died to-day, \\n 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth \\n This unprevailing woe, and think of us \\n As of a father: for let the world take note, \\n You are the most immediate to our throne; \\n And with no less nobility of love \\n Than that which dearest father bears his son, \\n Do I impart toward you. For your intent \\n In going back to school in Wittenberg, \\n It is most retrograde to our desire: \\n And we beseech you, bend you to remain \\n Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, \\n Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: \\n I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I shall in all my best obey you, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: \\n Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; \\n This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet \\n Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof, \\n No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, \\n But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, \\n And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again, \\n Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O, that this too too solid flesh would melt \\n Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! \\n Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd \\n His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! \\n How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, \\n Seem to me all the uses of this world! \\n Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, \\n That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature \\n Possess it merely. That it should come to this! \\n But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: \\n So excellent a king; that was, to this, \\n Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother \\n That he might not beteem the winds of heaven \\n Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! \\n Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, \\n As if increase of appetite had grown \\n By what it fed on: and yet, within a month-- \\n Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!-- \\n A little month, or ere those shoes were old \\n With which she follow'd my poor father's body, \\n Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she-- \\n O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, \\n Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle, \\n My father's brother, but no more like my father \\n Than I to Hercules: within a month: \\n Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears \\n Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, \\n She married. O, most wicked speed, to post \\n With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! \\n It is not nor it cannot come to good: \\n But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Hail to your lordship! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I am glad to see you well: \\n Horatio,--or I do forget myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you: \\n And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n My good lord-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. \\n But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n A truant disposition, good my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I would not hear your enemy say so, \\n Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, \\n To make it truster of your own report \\n Against yourself: I know you are no truant. \\n But what is your affair in Elsinore? \\n We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n My lord, I came to see your father's funeral. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; \\n I think it was to see my mother's wedding. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats \\n Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. \\n Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven \\n Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! \\n My father!--methinks I see my father. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Where, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n In my mind's eye, Horatio. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n I saw him once; he was a goodly king. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n He was a man, take him for all in all, \\n I shall not look upon his like again. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n My lord, I think I saw him yesternight. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Saw? who? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n My lord, the king your father. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The king my father! \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Season your admiration for awhile \\n With an attent ear, till I may deliver, \\n Upon the witness of these gentlemen, \\n This marvel to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n For God's love, let me hear. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Two nights together had these gentlemen, \\n Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, \\n In the dead vast and middle of the night, \\n Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father, \\n Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, \\n Appears before them, and with solemn march \\n Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd \\n By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, \\n Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled \\n Almost to jelly with the act of fear, \\n Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me \\n In dreadful secrecy impart they did; \\n And I with them the third night kept the watch; \\n Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, \\n Form of the thing, each word made true and good, \\n The apparition comes: I knew your father; \\n These hands are not more like. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n But where was this? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Did you not speak to it? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n My lord, I did; \\n But answer made it none: yet once methought \\n It lifted up its head and did address \\n Itself to motion, like as it would speak; \\n But even then the morning cock crew loud, \\n And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, \\n And vanish'd from our sight. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n 'Tis very strange. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; \\n And we did think it writ down in our duty \\n To let you know of it. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. \\n Hold you the watch to-night? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n BERNARDO \\n We do, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Arm'd, say you? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n BERNARDO \\n Arm'd, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n From top to toe? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n BERNARDO \\n My lord, from head to foot. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Then saw you not his face? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What, look'd he frowningly? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n A countenance more in sorrow than in anger. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Pale or red? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Nay, very pale. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n And fix'd his eyes upon you? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Most constantly. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I would I had been there. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n It would have much amazed you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Very like, very like. Stay'd it long? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n BERNARDO \\n Longer, longer. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Not when I saw't. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n His beard was grizzled--no? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n It was, as I have seen it in his life, \\n A sable silver'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I will watch to-night; \\n Perchance 'twill walk again. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n I warrant it will. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n If it assume my noble father's person, \\n I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape \\n And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, \\n If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, \\n Let it be tenable in your silence still; \\n And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, \\n Give it an understanding, but no tongue: \\n I will requite your loves. So, fare you well: \\n Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, \\n I'll visit you. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Our duty to your honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. \\n Exeunt all but HAMLET \\n My father's spirit in arms! all is not well; \\n I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! \\n Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, \\n Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A room in Polonius' house. \\n Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n My necessaries are embark'd: farewell: \\n And, sister, as the winds give benefit \\n And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, \\n But let me hear from you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Do you doubt that? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, \\n Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, \\n A violet in the youth of primy nature, \\n Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, \\n The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n No more but so? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Think it no more; \\n For nature, crescent, does not grow alone \\n In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, \\n The inward service of the mind and soul \\n Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, \\n And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch \\n The virtue of his will: but you must fear, \\n His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; \\n For he himself is subject to his birth: \\n He may not, as unvalued persons do, \\n Carve for himself; for on his choice depends \\n The safety and health of this whole state; \\n And therefore must his choice be circumscribed \\n Unto the voice and yielding of that body \\n Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, \\n It fits your wisdom so far to believe it \\n As he in his particular act and place \\n May give his saying deed; which is no further \\n Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. \\n Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, \\n If with too credent ear you list his songs, \\n Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open \\n To his unmaster'd importunity. \\n Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, \\n And keep you in the rear of your affection, \\n Out of the shot and danger of desire. \\n The chariest maid is prodigal enough, \\n If she unmask her beauty to the moon: \\n Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes: \\n The canker galls the infants of the spring, \\n Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, \\n And in the morn and liquid dew of youth \\n Contagious blastments are most imminent. \\n Be wary then; best safety lies in fear: \\n Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, \\n As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, \\n Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, \\n Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; \\n Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, \\n Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, \\n And recks not his own rede. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n O, fear me not. \\n I stay too long: but here my father comes. \\n Enter POLONIUS \\n A double blessing is a double grace, \\n Occasion smiles upon a second leave. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! \\n The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, \\n And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee! \\n And these few precepts in thy memory \\n See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, \\n Nor any unproportioned thought his act. \\n Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. \\n Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, \\n Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; \\n But do not dull thy palm with entertainment \\n Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware \\n Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, \\n Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee. \\n Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; \\n Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. \\n Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, \\n But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; \\n For the apparel oft proclaims the man, \\n And they in France of the best rank and station \\n Are of a most select and generous chief in that. \\n Neither a borrower nor a lender be; \\n For loan oft loses both itself and friend, \\n And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. \\n This above all: to thine ownself be true, \\n And it must follow, as the night the day, \\n Thou canst not then be false to any man. \\n Farewell: my blessing season this in thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n The time invites you; go; your servants tend. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well \\n What I have said to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n 'Tis in my memory lock'd, \\n And you yourself shall keep the key of it. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Farewell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Marry, well bethought: \\n 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late \\n Given private time to you; and you yourself \\n Have of your audience been most free and bounteous: \\n If it be so, as so 'tis put on me, \\n And that in way of caution, I must tell you, \\n You do not understand yourself so clearly \\n As it behoves my daughter and your honour. \\n What is between you? give me up the truth. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders \\n Of his affection to me. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, \\n Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. \\n Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n I do not know, my lord, what I should think. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby; \\n That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, \\n Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; \\n Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, \\n Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n My lord, he hath importuned me with love \\n In honourable fashion. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, \\n With almost all the holy vows of heaven. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, \\n When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul \\n Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, \\n Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, \\n Even in their promise, as it is a-making, \\n You must not take for fire. From this time \\n Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence; \\n Set your entreatments at a higher rate \\n Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, \\n Believe so much in him, that he is young \\n And with a larger tether may he walk \\n Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia, \\n Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, \\n Not of that dye which their investments show, \\n But mere implorators of unholy suits, \\n Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, \\n The better to beguile. This is for all: \\n I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, \\n Have you so slander any moment leisure, \\n As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. \\n Look to't, I charge you: come your ways. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n I shall obey, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  The platform. \\n Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n It is a nipping and an eager air. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What hour now? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n I think it lacks of twelve. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, it is struck. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season \\n Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. \\n A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within \\n What does this mean, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, \\n Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; \\n And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, \\n The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out \\n The triumph of his pledge. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Is it a custom? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, marry, is't: \\n But to my mind, though I am native here \\n And to the manner born, it is a custom \\n More honour'd in the breach than the observance. \\n This heavy-headed revel east and west \\n Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations: \\n They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase \\n Soil our addition; and indeed it takes \\n From our achievements, though perform'd at height, \\n The pith and marrow of our attribute. \\n So, oft it chances in particular men, \\n That for some vicious mole of nature in them, \\n As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty, \\n Since nature cannot choose his origin-- \\n By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, \\n Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, \\n Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens \\n The form of plausive manners, that these men, \\n Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, \\n Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,-- \\n Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace, \\n As infinite as man may undergo-- \\n Shall in the general censure take corruption \\n From that particular fault: the dram of eale \\n Doth all the noble substance of a doubt \\n To his own scandal. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Look, my lord, it comes! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Ghost \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Angels and ministers of grace defend us! \\n Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, \\n Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, \\n Be thy intents wicked or charitable, \\n Thou comest in such a questionable shape \\n That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, \\n King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me! \\n Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell \\n Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, \\n Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, \\n Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, \\n Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws, \\n To cast thee up again. What may this mean, \\n That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel \\n Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon, \\n Making night hideous; and we fools of nature \\n So horridly to shake our disposition \\n With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? \\n Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? \\n \\n\\n\\n Ghost beckons HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n It beckons you to go away with it, \\n As if it some impartment did desire \\n To you alone. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Look, with what courteous action \\n It waves you to a more removed ground: \\n But do not go with it. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n No, by no means. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It will not speak; then I will follow it. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Do not, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, what should be the fear? \\n I do not set my life in a pin's fee; \\n And for my soul, what can it do to that, \\n Being a thing immortal as itself? \\n It waves me forth again: I'll follow it. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, \\n Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff \\n That beetles o'er his base into the sea, \\n And there assume some other horrible form, \\n Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason \\n And draw you into madness? think of it: \\n The very place puts toys of desperation, \\n Without more motive, into every brain \\n That looks so many fathoms to the sea \\n And hears it roar beneath. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It waves me still. \\n Go on; I'll follow thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n You shall not go, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Hold off your hands. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Be ruled; you shall not go. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n My fate cries out, \\n And makes each petty artery in this body \\n As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. \\n Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen. \\n By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! \\n I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n He waxes desperate with imagination. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Have after. To what issue will this come? \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Heaven will direct it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Nay, let's follow him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Another part of the platform. \\n Enter GHOST and HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Mark me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I will. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n My hour is almost come, \\n When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames \\n Must render up myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Alas, poor ghost! \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing \\n To what I shall unfold. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Speak; I am bound to hear. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What? \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n I am thy father's spirit, \\n Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, \\n And for the day confined to fast in fires, \\n Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature \\n Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid \\n To tell the secrets of my prison-house, \\n I could a tale unfold whose lightest word \\n Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, \\n Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, \\n Thy knotted and combined locks to part \\n And each particular hair to stand on end, \\n Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: \\n But this eternal blazon must not be \\n To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! \\n If thou didst ever thy dear father love-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O God! \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Murder! \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Murder most foul, as in the best it is; \\n But this most foul, strange and unnatural. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift \\n As meditation or the thoughts of love, \\n May sweep to my revenge. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n I find thee apt; \\n And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed \\n That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, \\n Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: \\n 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, \\n A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark \\n Is by a forged process of my death \\n Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth, \\n The serpent that did sting thy father's life \\n Now wears his crown. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O my prophetic soul! My uncle! \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, \\n With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,-- \\n O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power \\n So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust \\n The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen: \\n O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! \\n From me, whose love was of that dignity \\n That it went hand in hand even with the vow \\n I made to her in marriage, and to decline \\n Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor \\n To those of mine! \\n But virtue, as it never will be moved, \\n Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, \\n So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, \\n Will sate itself in a celestial bed, \\n And prey on garbage. \\n But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air; \\n Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, \\n My custom always of the afternoon, \\n Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, \\n With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, \\n And in the porches of my ears did pour \\n The leperous distilment; whose effect \\n Holds such an enmity with blood of man \\n That swift as quicksilver it courses through \\n The natural gates and alleys of the body, \\n And with a sudden vigour doth posset \\n And curd, like eager droppings into milk, \\n The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; \\n And a most instant tetter bark'd about, \\n Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, \\n All my smooth body. \\n Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand \\n Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd: \\n Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, \\n Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, \\n No reckoning made, but sent to my account \\n With all my imperfections on my head: \\n O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! \\n If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; \\n Let not the royal bed of Denmark be \\n A couch for luxury and damned incest. \\n But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, \\n Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive \\n Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven \\n And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, \\n To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! \\n The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, \\n And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire: \\n Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else? \\n And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart; \\n And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, \\n But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! \\n Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat \\n In this distracted globe. Remember thee! \\n Yea, from the table of my memory \\n I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, \\n All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, \\n That youth and observation copied there; \\n And thy commandment all alone shall live \\n Within the book and volume of my brain, \\n Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! \\n O most pernicious woman! \\n O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! \\n My tables,--meet it is I set it down, \\n That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; \\n At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark: \\n Writing \\n So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; \\n It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.' \\n I have sworn 't. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n HORATIO \\n Within   My lord, my lord,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Within  Lord Hamlet,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Within  Heaven secure him! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n So be it! \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Within   Hillo, ho, ho, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n How is't, my noble lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n What news, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O, wonderful! \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Good my lord, tell it. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No; you'll reveal it. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Not I, my lord, by heaven. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Nor I, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? \\n But you'll be secret? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n MARCELLUS \\n Ay, by heaven, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark \\n But he's an arrant knave. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave \\n To tell us this. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, right; you are i' the right; \\n And so, without more circumstance at all, \\n I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: \\n You, as your business and desire shall point you; \\n For every man has business and desire, \\n Such as it is; and for mine own poor part, \\n Look you, I'll go pray. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n These are but wild and whirling words, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I'm sorry they offend you, heartily; \\n Yes, 'faith heartily. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n There's no offence, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, \\n And much offence too. Touching this vision here, \\n It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: \\n For your desire to know what is between us, \\n O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends, \\n As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, \\n Give me one poor request. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n What is't, my lord? we will. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Never make known what you have seen to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n MARCELLUS \\n My lord, we will not. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nay, but swear't. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n In faith, \\n My lord, not I. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n Nor I, my lord, in faith. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Upon my sword. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARCELLUS \\n We have sworn, my lord, already. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Indeed, upon my sword, indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Beneath   Swear. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, \\n truepenny? \\n Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage-- \\n Consent to swear. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Propose the oath, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Never to speak of this that you have seen, \\n Swear by my sword. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Beneath   Swear. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. \\n Come hither, gentlemen, \\n And lay your hands again upon my sword: \\n Never to speak of this that you have heard, \\n Swear by my sword. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Beneath   Swear. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? \\n A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. \\n There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, \\n Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come; \\n Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, \\n How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, \\n As I perchance hereafter shall think meet \\n To put an antic disposition on, \\n That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, \\n With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake, \\n Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, \\n As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,' \\n Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' \\n Or such ambiguous giving out, to note \\n That you know aught of me: this not to do, \\n So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear. \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Beneath   Swear. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! \\n They swear \\n So, gentlemen, \\n With all my love I do commend me to you: \\n And what so poor a man as Hamlet is \\n May do, to express his love and friending to you, \\n God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; \\n And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. \\n The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, \\n That ever I was born to set it right! \\n Nay, come, let's go together. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT II \\n\\n SCENE I.  A room in POLONIUS' house. \\n Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n I will, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, \\n Before you visit him, to make inquire \\n Of his behavior. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n My lord, I did intend it. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, \\n Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; \\n And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, \\n What company, at what expense; and finding \\n By this encompassment and drift of question \\n That they do know my son, come you more nearer \\n Than your particular demands will touch it: \\n Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; \\n As thus, 'I know his father and his friends, \\n And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo? \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n Ay, very well, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n 'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well: \\n But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild; \\n Addicted so and so:' and there put on him \\n What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank \\n As may dishonour him; take heed of that; \\n But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips \\n As are companions noted and most known \\n To youth and liberty. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n As gaming, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, \\n Drabbing: you may go so far. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n My lord, that would dishonour him. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n 'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge \\n You must not put another scandal on him, \\n That he is open to incontinency; \\n That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly \\n That they may seem the taints of liberty, \\n The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, \\n A savageness in unreclaimed blood, \\n Of general assault. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n But, my good lord,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Wherefore should you do this? \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n Ay, my lord, \\n I would know that. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Marry, sir, here's my drift; \\n And I believe, it is a fetch of wit: \\n You laying these slight sullies on my son, \\n As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you, \\n Your party in converse, him you would sound, \\n Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes \\n The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured \\n He closes with you in this consequence; \\n 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,' \\n According to the phrase or the addition \\n Of man and country. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n Very good, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I \\n about to say? By the mass, I was about to say \\n something: where did I leave? \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' \\n and 'gentleman.' \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry; \\n He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman; \\n I saw him yesterday, or t' other day, \\n Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say, \\n There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; \\n There falling out at tennis:' or perchance, \\n 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' \\n Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. \\n See you now; \\n Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: \\n And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, \\n With windlasses and with assays of bias, \\n By indirections find directions out: \\n So by my former lecture and advice, \\n Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n My lord, I have. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n God be wi' you; fare you well. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n Good my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Observe his inclination in yourself. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n I shall, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n And let him ply his music. \\n \\n\\n \\n REYNALDO \\n Well, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Farewell! \\n Exit REYNALDO \\n Enter OPHELIA \\n How now, Ophelia! what's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n With what, i' the name of God? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, \\n Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; \\n No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd, \\n Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle; \\n Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; \\n And with a look so piteous in purport \\n As if he had been loosed out of hell \\n To speak of horrors,--he comes before me. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Mad for thy love? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n My lord, I do not know; \\n But truly, I do fear it. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n What said he? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n He took me by the wrist and held me hard; \\n Then goes he to the length of all his arm; \\n And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, \\n He falls to such perusal of my face \\n As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so; \\n At last, a little shaking of mine arm \\n And thrice his head thus waving up and down, \\n He raised a sigh so piteous and profound \\n As it did seem to shatter all his bulk \\n And end his being: that done, he lets me go: \\n And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, \\n He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; \\n For out o' doors he went without their helps, \\n And, to the last, bended their light on me. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Come, go with me: I will go seek the king. \\n This is the very ecstasy of love, \\n Whose violent property fordoes itself \\n And leads the will to desperate undertakings \\n As oft as any passion under heaven \\n That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. \\n What, have you given him any hard words of late? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n No, my good lord, but, as you did command, \\n I did repel his fetters and denied \\n His access to me. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n That hath made him mad. \\n I am sorry that with better heed and judgment \\n I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle, \\n And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy! \\n By heaven, it is as proper to our age \\n To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions \\n As it is common for the younger sort \\n To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king: \\n This must be known; which, being kept close, might \\n move \\n More grief to hide than hate to utter love. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A room in the castle. \\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,\\nGUILDENSTERN, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! \\n Moreover that we much did long to see you, \\n The need we have to use you did provoke \\n Our hasty sending. Something have you heard \\n Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it, \\n Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man \\n Resembles that it was. What it should be, \\n More than his father's death, that thus hath put him \\n So much from the understanding of himself, \\n I cannot dream of: I entreat you both, \\n That, being of so young days brought up with him, \\n And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior, \\n That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court \\n Some little time: so by your companies \\n To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, \\n So much as from occasion you may glean, \\n Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, \\n That, open'd, lies within our remedy. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you; \\n And sure I am two men there are not living \\n To whom he more adheres. If it will please you \\n To show us so much gentry and good will \\n As to expend your time with us awhile, \\n For the supply and profit of our hope, \\n Your visitation shall receive such thanks \\n As fits a king's remembrance. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Both your majesties \\n Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, \\n Put your dread pleasures more into command \\n Than to entreaty. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n But we both obey, \\n And here give up ourselves, in the full bent \\n To lay our service freely at your feet, \\n To be commanded. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: \\n And I beseech you instantly to visit \\n My too much changed son. Go, some of you, \\n And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Heavens make our presence and our practises \\n Pleasant and helpful to him! \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Ay, amen! \\n \\n\\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some\\nAttendants \\n Enter POLONIUS \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, \\n Are joyfully return'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Thou still hast been the father of good news. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege, \\n I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, \\n Both to my God and to my gracious king: \\n And I do think, or else this brain of mine \\n Hunts not the trail of policy so sure \\n As it hath used to do, that I have found \\n The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n O, speak of that; that do I long to hear. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Give first admittance to the ambassadors; \\n My news shall be the fruit to that great feast. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. \\n Exit POLONIUS \\n He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found \\n The head and source of all your son's distemper. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n I doubt it is no other but the main; \\n His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Well, we shall sift him. \\n Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS \\n Welcome, my good friends! \\n Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway? \\n \\n\\n \\n VOLTIMAND \\n Most fair return of greetings and desires. \\n Upon our first, he sent out to suppress \\n His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd \\n To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; \\n But, better look'd into, he truly found \\n It was against your highness: whereat grieved, \\n That so his sickness, age and impotence \\n Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests \\n On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; \\n Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine \\n Makes vow before his uncle never more \\n To give the assay of arms against your majesty. \\n Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, \\n Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, \\n And his commission to employ those soldiers, \\n So levied as before, against the Polack: \\n With an entreaty, herein further shown, \\n Giving a paper \\n That it might please you to give quiet pass \\n Through your dominions for this enterprise, \\n On such regards of safety and allowance \\n As therein are set down. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n It likes us well; \\n And at our more consider'd time well read, \\n Answer, and think upon this business. \\n Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour: \\n Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together: \\n Most welcome home! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n This business is well ended. \\n My liege, and madam, to expostulate \\n What majesty should be, what duty is, \\n Why day is day, night night, and time is time, \\n Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. \\n Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, \\n And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, \\n I will be brief: your noble son is mad: \\n Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, \\n What is't but to be nothing else but mad? \\n But let that go. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n More matter, with less art. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Madam, I swear I use no art at all. \\n That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; \\n And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure; \\n But farewell it, for I will use no art. \\n Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains \\n That we find out the cause of this effect, \\n Or rather say, the cause of this defect, \\n For this effect defective comes by cause: \\n Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. \\n I have a daughter--have while she is mine-- \\n Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, \\n Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise. \\n Reads \\n 'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most \\n beautified Ophelia,'-- \\n That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is \\n a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus: \\n Reads \\n 'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.' \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Came this from Hamlet to her? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. \\n Reads \\n 'Doubt thou the stars are fire; \\n Doubt that the sun doth move; \\n Doubt truth to be a liar; \\n But never doubt I love. \\n 'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; \\n I have not art to reckon my groans: but that \\n I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu. \\n 'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst \\n this machine is to him, HAMLET.' \\n This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me, \\n And more above, hath his solicitings, \\n As they fell out by time, by means and place, \\n All given to mine ear. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n But how hath she \\n Received his love? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n What do you think of me? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n As of a man faithful and honourable. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n I would fain prove so. But what might you think, \\n When I had seen this hot love on the wing-- \\n As I perceived it, I must tell you that, \\n Before my daughter told me--what might you, \\n Or my dear majesty your queen here, think, \\n If I had play'd the desk or table-book, \\n Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, \\n Or look'd upon this love with idle sight; \\n What might you think? No, I went round to work, \\n And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: \\n 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; \\n This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her, \\n That she should lock herself from his resort, \\n Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. \\n Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; \\n And he, repulsed--a short tale to make-- \\n Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, \\n Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, \\n Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, \\n Into the madness wherein now he raves, \\n And all we mourn for. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Do you think 'tis this? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n It may be, very likely. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that-- \\n That I have positively said 'Tis so,' \\n When it proved otherwise? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Not that I know. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Pointing to his head and shoulder \\n Take this from this, if this be otherwise: \\n If circumstances lead me, I will find \\n Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed \\n Within the centre. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n How may we try it further? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n You know, sometimes he walks four hours together \\n Here in the lobby. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n So he does indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him: \\n Be you and I behind an arras then; \\n Mark the encounter: if he love her not \\n And be not from his reason fall'n thereon, \\n Let me be no assistant for a state, \\n But keep a farm and carters. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n We will try it. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Away, I do beseech you, both away: \\n I'll board him presently. \\n Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and\\nAttendants \\n Enter HAMLET, reading \\n O, give me leave: \\n How does my good Lord Hamlet? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Well, God-a-mercy. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Do you know me, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Excellent well; you are a fishmonger. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Not I, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Then I would you were so honest a man. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Honest, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be \\n one man picked out of ten thousand. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n That's very true, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a \\n god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n I have, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a \\n blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive. \\n Friend, look to 't. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Aside   How say you by that? Still harping on my \\n daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I \\n was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and \\n truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for \\n love; very near this. I'll speak to him again. \\n What do you read, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Words, words, words. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n What is the matter, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Between who? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n I mean, the matter that you read, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here \\n that old men have grey beards, that their faces are \\n wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and \\n plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of \\n wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, \\n though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet \\n I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for \\n yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab \\n you could go backward. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Aside   Though this be madness, yet there is method \\n in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Into my grave. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Indeed, that is out o' the air. \\n Aside \\n How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness \\n that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity \\n could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will \\n leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of \\n meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable \\n lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will \\n more willingly part withal: except my life, except \\n my life, except my life. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Fare you well, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n These tedious old fools! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n To POLONIUS   God save you, sir! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit POLONIUS \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n My honoured lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n My most dear lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n My excellent good friends! How dost thou, \\n Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n As the indifferent children of the earth. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Happy, in that we are not over-happy; \\n On fortune's cap we are not the very button. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nor the soles of her shoe? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Neither, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of \\n her favours? \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n 'Faith, her privates we. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she \\n is a strumpet. What's the news? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. \\n Let me question more in particular: what have you, \\n my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, \\n that she sends you to prison hither? \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Prison, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Denmark's a prison. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Then is the world one. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n A goodly one; in which there are many confines, \\n wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n We think not so, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing \\n either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me \\n it is a prison. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too \\n narrow for your mind. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count \\n myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I \\n have bad dreams. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very \\n substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n A dream itself is but a shadow. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a \\n quality that it is but a shadow's shadow. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and \\n outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we \\n to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n We'll wait upon you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest \\n of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest \\n man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the \\n beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I \\n thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are \\n too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it \\n your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, \\n deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n What should we say, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent \\n for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks \\n which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: \\n I know the good king and queen have sent for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n To what end, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by \\n the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of \\n our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved \\n love, and by what more dear a better proposer could \\n charge you withal, be even and direct with me, \\n whether you were sent for, or no? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Aside to GUILDENSTERN   What say you? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Aside   Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you \\n love me, hold not off. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n My lord, we were sent for. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation \\n prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king \\n and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but \\n wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all \\n custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily \\n with my disposition that this goodly frame, the \\n earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most \\n excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave \\n o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted \\n with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to \\n me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. \\n What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! \\n how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how \\n express and admirable! in action how like an angel! \\n in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the \\n world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, \\n what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not \\n me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling \\n you seem to say so. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what \\n lenten entertainment the players shall receive from \\n you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they \\n coming, to offer you service. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty \\n shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight \\n shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not \\n sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part \\n in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose \\n lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall \\n say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt \\n for't. What players are they? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Even those you were wont to take delight in, the \\n tragedians of the city. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How chances it they travel? their residence, both \\n in reputation and profit, was better both ways. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n I think their inhibition comes by the means of the \\n late innovation. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was \\n in the city? are they so followed? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n No, indeed, are they not. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How comes it? do they grow rusty? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but \\n there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, \\n that cry out on the top of question, and are most \\n tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the \\n fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they \\n call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of \\n goose-quills and dare scarce come thither. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are \\n they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no \\n longer than they can sing? will they not say \\n afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common \\n players--as it is most like, if their means are no \\n better--their writers do them wrong, to make them \\n exclaim against their own succession? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n 'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and \\n the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to \\n controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid \\n for argument, unless the poet and the player went to \\n cuffs in the question. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Is't possible? \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n O, there has been much throwing about of brains. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Do the boys carry it away? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of \\n Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while \\n my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an \\n hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. \\n 'Sblood, there is something in this more than \\n natural, if philosophy could find it out. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish of trumpets within \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n There are the players. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, \\n come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion \\n and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, \\n lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, \\n must show fairly outward, should more appear like \\n entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my \\n uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n In what, my dear lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is \\n southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter POLONIUS \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Well be with you, gentlemen! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a \\n hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet \\n out of his swaddling-clouts. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Happily he's the second time come to them; for they \\n say an old man is twice a child. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; \\n mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning; \\n 'twas so indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n My lord, I have news to tell you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n My lord, I have news to tell you. \\n When Roscius was an actor in Rome,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n The actors are come hither, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Buz, buz! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Upon mine honour,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Then came each actor on his ass,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, \\n comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, \\n historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical- \\n comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or \\n poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor \\n Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the \\n liberty, these are the only men. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n What a treasure had he, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, \\n 'One fair daughter and no more, \\n The which he loved passing well.' \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Aside   Still on my daughter. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter \\n that I love passing well. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nay, that follows not. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n What follows, then, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, \\n 'As by lot, God wot,' \\n and then, you know, \\n 'It came to pass, as most like it was,'-- \\n the first row of the pious chanson will show you \\n more; for look, where my abridgement comes. \\n Enter four or five Players \\n You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad \\n to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old \\n friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last: \\n comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young \\n lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is \\n nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the \\n altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like \\n apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the \\n ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en \\n to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see: \\n we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste \\n of your quality; come, a passionate speech. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n What speech, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was \\n never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the \\n play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas \\n caviare to the general: but it was--as I received \\n it, and others, whose judgments in such matters \\n cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well \\n digested in the scenes, set down with as much \\n modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there \\n were no sallets in the lines to make the matter \\n savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might \\n indict the author of affectation; but called it an \\n honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very \\n much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I \\n chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and \\n thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of \\n Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin \\n at this line: let me see, let me see-- \\n 'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'-- \\n it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:-- \\n 'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, \\n Black as his purpose, did the night resemble \\n When he lay couched in the ominous horse, \\n Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd \\n With heraldry more dismal; head to foot \\n Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd \\n With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, \\n Baked and impasted with the parching streets, \\n That lend a tyrannous and damned light \\n To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire, \\n And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore, \\n With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus \\n Old grandsire Priam seeks.' \\n So, proceed you. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and \\n good discretion. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n 'Anon he finds him \\n Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword, \\n Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, \\n Repugnant to command: unequal match'd, \\n Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide; \\n But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword \\n The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, \\n Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top \\n Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash \\n Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword, \\n Which was declining on the milky head \\n Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick: \\n So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, \\n And like a neutral to his will and matter, \\n Did nothing. \\n But, as we often see, against some storm, \\n A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, \\n The bold winds speechless and the orb below \\n As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder \\n Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause, \\n Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; \\n And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall \\n On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne \\n With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword \\n Now falls on Priam. \\n Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods, \\n In general synod 'take away her power; \\n Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, \\n And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, \\n As low as to the fiends!' \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n This is too long. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee, \\n say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he \\n sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n 'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--' \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n 'The mobled queen?' \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n That's good; 'mobled queen' is good. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n 'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames \\n With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head \\n Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, \\n About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins, \\n A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; \\n Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd, \\n 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have \\n pronounced: \\n But if the gods themselves did see her then \\n When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport \\n In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, \\n The instant burst of clamour that she made, \\n Unless things mortal move them not at all, \\n Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, \\n And passion in the gods.' \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has \\n tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n 'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon. \\n Good my lord, will you see the players well \\n bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for \\n they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the \\n time: after your death you were better have a bad \\n epitaph than their ill report while you live. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n My lord, I will use them according to their desert. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man \\n after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping? \\n Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less \\n they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. \\n Take them in. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Come, sirs. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow. \\n Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First \\n Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the \\n Murder of Gonzago? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n Ay, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, \\n study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which \\n I would set down and insert in't, could you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n Ay, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him \\n not. \\n Exit First Player \\n My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are \\n welcome to Elsinore. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Good my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, so, God be wi' ye; \\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n Now I am alone. \\n O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! \\n Is it not monstrous that this player here, \\n But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, \\n Could force his soul so to his own conceit \\n That from her working all his visage wann'd, \\n Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, \\n A broken voice, and his whole function suiting \\n With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! \\n For Hecuba! \\n What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, \\n That he should weep for her? What would he do, \\n Had he the motive and the cue for passion \\n That I have? He would drown the stage with tears \\n And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, \\n Make mad the guilty and appal the free, \\n Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed \\n The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, \\n A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, \\n Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, \\n And can say nothing; no, not for a king, \\n Upon whose property and most dear life \\n A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? \\n Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? \\n Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face? \\n Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, \\n As deep as to the lungs? who does me this? \\n Ha! \\n 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be \\n But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall \\n To make oppression bitter, or ere this \\n I should have fatted all the region kites \\n With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! \\n Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! \\n O, vengeance! \\n Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, \\n That I, the son of a dear father murder'd, \\n Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, \\n Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, \\n And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, \\n A scullion! \\n Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard \\n That guilty creatures sitting at a play \\n Have by the very cunning of the scene \\n Been struck so to the soul that presently \\n They have proclaim'd their malefactions; \\n For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak \\n With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players \\n Play something like the murder of my father \\n Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks; \\n I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench, \\n I know my course. The spirit that I have seen \\n May be the devil: and the devil hath power \\n To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps \\n Out of my weakness and my melancholy, \\n As he is very potent with such spirits, \\n Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds \\n More relative than this: the play 's the thing \\n Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.  A room in the castle. \\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS,\\nOPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n And can you, by no drift of circumstance, \\n Get from him why he puts on this confusion, \\n Grating so harshly all his days of quiet \\n With turbulent and dangerous lunacy? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n He does confess he feels himself distracted; \\n But from what cause he will by no means speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, \\n But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, \\n When we would bring him on to some confession \\n Of his true state. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Did he receive you well? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Most like a gentleman. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n But with much forcing of his disposition. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Niggard of question; but, of our demands, \\n Most free in his reply. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Did you assay him? \\n To any pastime? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Madam, it so fell out, that certain players \\n We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him; \\n And there did seem in him a kind of joy \\n To hear of it: they are about the court, \\n And, as I think, they have already order \\n This night to play before him. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n 'Tis most true: \\n And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties \\n To hear and see the matter. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n With all my heart; and it doth much content me \\n To hear him so inclined. \\n Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, \\n And drive his purpose on to these delights. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n We shall, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; \\n For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, \\n That he, as 'twere by accident, may here \\n Affront Ophelia: \\n Her father and myself, lawful espials, \\n Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen, \\n We may of their encounter frankly judge, \\n And gather by him, as he is behaved, \\n If 't be the affliction of his love or no \\n That thus he suffers for. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n I shall obey you. \\n And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish \\n That your good beauties be the happy cause \\n Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues \\n Will bring him to his wonted way again, \\n To both your honours. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Madam, I wish it may. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you, \\n We will bestow ourselves. \\n To OPHELIA \\n Read on this book; \\n That show of such an exercise may colour \\n Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,-- \\n 'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage \\n And pious action we do sugar o'er \\n The devil himself. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Aside           O, 'tis too true! \\n How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! \\n The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, \\n Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it \\n Than is my deed to my most painted word: \\n O heavy burthen! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS \\n Enter HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n To be, or not to be: that is the question: \\n Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer \\n The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, \\n Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, \\n And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; \\n No more; and by a sleep to say we end \\n The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks \\n That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation \\n Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; \\n To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; \\n For in that sleep of death what dreams may come \\n When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, \\n Must give us pause: there's the respect \\n That makes calamity of so long life; \\n For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, \\n The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, \\n The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, \\n The insolence of office and the spurns \\n That patient merit of the unworthy takes, \\n When he himself might his quietus make \\n With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, \\n To grunt and sweat under a weary life, \\n But that the dread of something after death, \\n The undiscover'd country from whose bourn \\n No traveller returns, puzzles the will \\n And makes us rather bear those ills we have \\n Than fly to others that we know not of? \\n Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; \\n And thus the native hue of resolution \\n Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, \\n And enterprises of great pith and moment \\n With this regard their currents turn awry, \\n And lose the name of action.--Soft you now! \\n The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons \\n Be all my sins remember'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Good my lord, \\n How does your honour for this many a day? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I humbly thank you; well, well, well. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n My lord, I have remembrances of yours, \\n That I have longed long to re-deliver; \\n I pray you, now receive them. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, not I; \\n I never gave you aught. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n My honour'd lord, you know right well you did; \\n And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed \\n As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, \\n Take these again; for to the noble mind \\n Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. \\n There, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ha, ha! are you honest? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Are you fair? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n What means your lordship? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should \\n admit no discourse to your beauty. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than \\n with honesty? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner \\n transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the \\n force of honesty can translate beauty into his \\n likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the \\n time gives it proof. I did love you once. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot \\n so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of \\n it: I loved you not. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n I was the more deceived. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a \\n breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; \\n but yet I could accuse me of such things that it \\n were better my mother had not borne me: I am very \\n proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at \\n my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, \\n imagination to give them shape, or time to act them \\n in. What should such fellows as I do crawling \\n between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, \\n all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. \\n Where's your father? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n At home, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the \\n fool no where but in's own house. Farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n O, help him, you sweet heavens! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for \\n thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as \\n snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a \\n nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs \\n marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough \\n what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, \\n and quickly too. Farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n O heavenly powers, restore him! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God \\n has given you one face, and you make yourselves \\n another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and \\n nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness \\n your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath \\n made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: \\n those that are married already, all but one, shall \\n live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a \\n nunnery, go. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! \\n The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; \\n The expectancy and rose of the fair state, \\n The glass of fashion and the mould of form, \\n The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! \\n And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, \\n That suck'd the honey of his music vows, \\n Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, \\n Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; \\n That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth \\n Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me, \\n To have seen what I have seen, see what I see! \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Love! his affections do not that way tend; \\n Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, \\n Was not like madness. There's something in his soul, \\n O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; \\n And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose \\n Will be some danger: which for to prevent, \\n I have in quick determination \\n Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England, \\n For the demand of our neglected tribute \\n Haply the seas and countries different \\n With variable objects shall expel \\n This something-settled matter in his heart, \\n Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus \\n From fashion of himself. What think you on't? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n It shall do well: but yet do I believe \\n The origin and commencement of his grief \\n Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! \\n You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; \\n We heard it all. My lord, do as you please; \\n But, if you hold it fit, after the play \\n Let his queen mother all alone entreat him \\n To show his grief: let her be round with him; \\n And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear \\n Of all their conference. If she find him not, \\n To England send him, or confine him where \\n Your wisdom best shall think. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n It shall be so: \\n Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A hall in the castle. \\n Enter HAMLET and Players \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to \\n you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, \\n as many of your players do, I had as lief the \\n town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air \\n too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; \\n for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, \\n the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget \\n a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it \\n offends me to the soul to hear a robustious \\n periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to \\n very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who \\n for the most part are capable of nothing but \\n inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such \\n a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it \\n out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n I warrant your honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion \\n be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the \\n word to the action; with this special o'erstep not \\n the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is \\n from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the \\n first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the \\n mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, \\n scorn her own image, and the very age and body of \\n the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, \\n or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful \\n laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the \\n censure of the which one must in your allowance \\n o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be \\n players that I have seen play, and heard others \\n praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, \\n that, neither having the accent of Christians nor \\n the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so \\n strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of \\n nature's journeymen had made men and not made them \\n well, they imitated humanity so abominably. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Player \\n I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, \\n sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O, reform it altogether. And let those that play \\n your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; \\n for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to \\n set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh \\n too; though, in the mean time, some necessary \\n question of the play be then to be considered: \\n that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition \\n in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready. \\n Exeunt Players \\n Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN \\n How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n And the queen too, and that presently. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Bid the players make haste. \\n Exit POLONIUS \\n Will you two help to hasten them? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n We will, my lord. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What ho! Horatio! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HORATIO \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Here, sweet lord, at your service. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man \\n As e'er my conversation coped withal. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n O, my dear lord,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nay, do not think I flatter; \\n For what advancement may I hope from thee \\n That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, \\n To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd? \\n No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, \\n And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee \\n Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? \\n Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice \\n And could of men distinguish, her election \\n Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been \\n As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, \\n A man that fortune's buffets and rewards \\n Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those \\n Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled, \\n That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger \\n To sound what stop she please. Give me that man \\n That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him \\n In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, \\n As I do thee.--Something too much of this.-- \\n There is a play to-night before the king; \\n One scene of it comes near the circumstance \\n Which I have told thee of my father's death: \\n I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, \\n Even with the very comment of thy soul \\n Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt \\n Do not itself unkennel in one speech, \\n It is a damned ghost that we have seen, \\n And my imaginations are as foul \\n As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; \\n For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, \\n And after we will both our judgments join \\n In censure of his seeming. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Well, my lord: \\n If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, \\n And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n They are coming to the play; I must be idle: \\n Get you a place. \\n \\n\\n\\n Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS,\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ,\\nGUILDENSTERN, and others \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n How fares our cousin Hamlet? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat \\n the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words \\n are not mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, nor mine now. \\n To POLONIUS \\n My lord, you played once i' the university, you say? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What did you enact? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the \\n Capitol; Brutus killed me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf \\n there. Be the players ready? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, good mother, here's metal more attractive. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n To KING CLAUDIUS   O, ho! do you mark that? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Lady, shall I lie in your lap? \\n \\n\\n\\n Lying down at OPHELIA's feet \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n No, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I mean, my head upon your lap? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Ay, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Do you think I meant country matters? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n I think nothing, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n What is, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nothing. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n You are merry, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Who, I? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Ay, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do \\n but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my \\n mother looks, and my father died within these two hours. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for \\n I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two \\n months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's \\n hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half \\n a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches, \\n then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with \\n the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O, \\n the hobby-horse is forgot.' \\n Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters \\n \\n\\n Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen\\nembracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes\\nshow of protestation unto him. He takes her up,\\nand declines his head upon her neck: lays him down\\nupon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,\\nleaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his\\ncrown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's\\nears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King\\ndead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,\\nwith some two or three Mutes, comes in again,\\nseeming to lament with her. The dead body is\\ncarried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with\\ngifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but\\nin the end accepts his love \\n Exeunt \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n What means this, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Belike this show imports the argument of the play. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Prologue \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot \\n keep counsel; they'll tell all. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Will he tell us what this show meant? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you \\n ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play. \\n \\n\\n \\n Prologue \\n For us, and for our tragedy, \\n Here stooping to your clemency, \\n We beg your hearing patiently. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n 'Tis brief, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n As woman's love. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter two Players, King and Queen \\n\\n \\n Player King \\n Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round \\n Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground, \\n And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen \\n About the world have times twelve thirties been, \\n Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands \\n Unite commutual in most sacred bands. \\n \\n\\n \\n Player Queen \\n So many journeys may the sun and moon \\n Make us again count o'er ere love be done! \\n But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, \\n So far from cheer and from your former state, \\n That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, \\n Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: \\n For women's fear and love holds quantity; \\n In neither aught, or in extremity. \\n Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; \\n And as my love is sized, my fear is so: \\n Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; \\n Where little fears grow great, great love grows there. \\n \\n\\n \\n Player King \\n 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too; \\n My operant powers their functions leave to do: \\n And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, \\n Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind \\n For husband shalt thou-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Player Queen \\n O, confound the rest! \\n Such love must needs be treason in my breast: \\n In second husband let me be accurst! \\n None wed the second but who kill'd the first. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Aside   Wormwood, wormwood. \\n \\n\\n \\n Player Queen \\n The instances that second marriage move \\n Are base respects of thrift, but none of love: \\n A second time I kill my husband dead, \\n When second husband kisses me in bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n Player King \\n I do believe you think what now you speak; \\n But what we do determine oft we break. \\n Purpose is but the slave to memory, \\n Of violent birth, but poor validity; \\n Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree; \\n But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. \\n Most necessary 'tis that we forget \\n To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt: \\n What to ourselves in passion we propose, \\n The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. \\n The violence of either grief or joy \\n Their own enactures with themselves destroy: \\n Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; \\n Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. \\n This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange \\n That even our loves should with our fortunes change; \\n For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, \\n Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. \\n The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; \\n The poor advanced makes friends of enemies. \\n And hitherto doth love on fortune tend; \\n For who not needs shall never lack a friend, \\n And who in want a hollow friend doth try, \\n Directly seasons him his enemy. \\n But, orderly to end where I begun, \\n Our wills and fates do so contrary run \\n That our devices still are overthrown; \\n Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: \\n So think thou wilt no second husband wed; \\n But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n Player Queen \\n Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! \\n Sport and repose lock from me day and night! \\n To desperation turn my trust and hope! \\n An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope! \\n Each opposite that blanks the face of joy \\n Meet what I would have well and it destroy! \\n Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, \\n If, once a widow, ever I be wife! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n If she should break it now! \\n \\n\\n \\n Player King \\n 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile; \\n My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile \\n The tedious day with sleep. \\n \\n\\n\\n Sleeps \\n\\n \\n Player Queen \\n Sleep rock thy brain, \\n And never come mischance between us twain! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Madam, how like you this play? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n The lady protests too much, methinks. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O, but she'll keep her word. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence \\n i' the world. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n What do you call the play? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play \\n is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is \\n the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see \\n anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o' \\n that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it \\n touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our \\n withers are unwrung. \\n Enter LUCIANUS \\n This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n You are as good as a chorus, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I could interpret between you and your love, if I \\n could see the puppets dallying. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n You are keen, my lord, you are keen. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Still better, and worse. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer; \\n pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come: \\n 'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.' \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIANUS \\n Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing; \\n Confederate season, else no creature seeing; \\n Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, \\n With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, \\n Thy natural magic and dire property, \\n On wholesome life usurp immediately. \\n \\n\\n\\n Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His \\n name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in \\n choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer \\n gets the love of Gonzago's wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n The king rises. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What, frighted with false fire! \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n How fares my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Give o'er the play. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Give me some light: away! \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Lights, lights, lights! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, let the stricken deer go weep, \\n The hart ungalled play; \\n For some must watch, while some must sleep: \\n So runs the world away. \\n Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if \\n the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two \\n Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a \\n fellowship in a cry of players, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Half a share. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n A whole one, I. \\n For thou dost know, O Damon dear, \\n This realm dismantled was \\n Of Jove himself; and now reigns here \\n A very, very--pajock. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n You might have rhymed. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a \\n thousand pound. Didst perceive? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Very well, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Upon the talk of the poisoning? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n I did very well note him. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders! \\n For if the king like not the comedy, \\n Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy. \\n Come, some music! \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Sir, a whole history. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n The king, sir,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, sir, what of him? \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Is in his retirement marvellous distempered. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n With drink, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n No, my lord, rather with choler. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Your wisdom should show itself more richer to \\n signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him \\n to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far \\n more choler. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and \\n start not so wildly from my affair. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I am tame, sir: pronounce. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of \\n spirit, hath sent me to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n You are welcome. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right \\n breed. If it shall please you to make me a \\n wholesome answer, I will do your mother's \\n commandment: if not, your pardon and my return \\n shall be the end of my business. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Sir, I cannot. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n What, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, \\n sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; \\n or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no \\n more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her \\n into amazement and admiration. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But \\n is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's \\n admiration? Impart. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you \\n go to bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have \\n you any further trade with us? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n My lord, you once did love me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n So I do still, by these pickers and stealers. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you \\n do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if \\n you deny your griefs to your friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Sir, I lack advancement. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n How can that be, when you have the voice of the king \\n himself for your succession in Denmark? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb \\n is something musty. \\n Re-enter Players with recorders \\n O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with \\n you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me, \\n as if you would drive me into a toil? \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too \\n unmannerly. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I do not well understand that. Will you play upon \\n this pipe? \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n My lord, I cannot. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I pray you. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Believe me, I cannot. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I do beseech you. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n I know no touch of it, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with \\n your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your \\n mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. \\n Look you, these are the stops. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n But these cannot I command to any utterance of \\n harmony; I have not the skill. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of \\n me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know \\n my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my \\n mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to \\n the top of my compass: and there is much music, \\n excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot \\n you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am \\n easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what \\n instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you \\n cannot play upon me. \\n Enter POLONIUS \\n God bless you, sir! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n My lord, the queen would speak with you, and \\n presently. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Methinks it is like a weasel. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n It is backed like a weasel. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Or like a whale? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Very like a whale. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool \\n me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n I will say so. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n By and by is easily said. \\n Exit POLONIUS \\n Leave me, friends. \\n Exeunt all but HAMLET \\n Tis now the very witching time of night, \\n When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out \\n Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood, \\n And do such bitter business as the day \\n Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. \\n O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever \\n The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom: \\n Let me be cruel, not unnatural: \\n I will speak daggers to her, but use none; \\n My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; \\n How in my words soever she be shent, \\n To give them seals never, my soul, consent! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A room in the castle. \\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n I like him not, nor stands it safe with us \\n To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you; \\n I your commission will forthwith dispatch, \\n And he to England shall along with you: \\n The terms of our estate may not endure \\n Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow \\n Out of his lunacies. \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n We will ourselves provide: \\n Most holy and religious fear it is \\n To keep those many many bodies safe \\n That live and feed upon your majesty. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n The single and peculiar life is bound, \\n With all the strength and armour of the mind, \\n To keep itself from noyance; but much more \\n That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest \\n The lives of many. The cease of majesty \\n Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw \\n What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel, \\n Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount, \\n To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things \\n Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, \\n Each small annexment, petty consequence, \\n Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone \\n Did the king sigh, but with a general groan. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; \\n For we will fetters put upon this fear, \\n Which now goes too free-footed. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n We will haste us. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n Enter POLONIUS \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n My lord, he's going to his mother's closet: \\n Behind the arras I'll convey myself, \\n To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home: \\n And, as you said, and wisely was it said, \\n 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, \\n Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear \\n The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege: \\n I'll call upon you ere you go to bed, \\n And tell you what I know. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Thanks, dear my lord. \\n Exit POLONIUS \\n O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven; \\n It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, \\n A brother's murder. Pray can I not, \\n Though inclination be as sharp as will: \\n My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent; \\n And, like a man to double business bound, \\n I stand in pause where I shall first begin, \\n And both neglect. What if this cursed hand \\n Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, \\n Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens \\n To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy \\n But to confront the visage of offence? \\n And what's in prayer but this two-fold force, \\n To be forestalled ere we come to fall, \\n Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up; \\n My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer \\n Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'? \\n That cannot be; since I am still possess'd \\n Of those effects for which I did the murder, \\n My crown, mine own ambition and my queen. \\n May one be pardon'd and retain the offence? \\n In the corrupted currents of this world \\n Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice, \\n And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself \\n Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above; \\n There is no shuffling, there the action lies \\n In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd, \\n Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, \\n To give in evidence. What then? what rests? \\n Try what repentance can: what can it not? \\n Yet what can it when one can not repent? \\n O wretched state! O bosom black as death! \\n O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, \\n Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay! \\n Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel, \\n Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe! \\n All may be well. \\n \\n\\n Retires and kneels \\n Enter HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Now might I do it pat, now he is praying; \\n And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven; \\n And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd: \\n A villain kills my father; and for that, \\n I, his sole son, do this same villain send \\n To heaven. \\n O, this is hire and salary, not revenge. \\n He took my father grossly, full of bread; \\n With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; \\n And how his audit stands who knows save heaven? \\n But in our circumstance and course of thought, \\n 'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged, \\n To take him in the purging of his soul, \\n When he is fit and season'd for his passage? \\n No! \\n Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent: \\n When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, \\n Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; \\n At gaming, swearing, or about some act \\n That has no relish of salvation in't; \\n Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, \\n And that his soul may be as damn'd and black \\n As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays: \\n This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Rising   My words fly up, my thoughts remain below: \\n Words without thoughts never to heaven go. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  The Queen's closet. \\n Enter QUEEN MARGARET and POLONIUS \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n He will come straight. Look you lay home to him: \\n Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, \\n And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between \\n Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here. \\n Pray you, be round with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Within   Mother, mother, mother! \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n I'll warrant you, \\n Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming. \\n \\n\\n POLONIUS hides behind the arras \\n Enter HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Now, mother, what's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Mother, you have my father much offended. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Why, how now, Hamlet! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What's the matter now? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Have you forgot me? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, by the rood, not so: \\n You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; \\n And--would it were not so!--you are my mother. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; \\n You go not till I set you up a glass \\n Where you may see the inmost part of you. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? \\n Help, help, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Behind   What, ho! help, help, help! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Drawing   How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead! \\n \\n\\n\\n Makes a pass through the arras \\n\\n \\n LORD POLONIUS \\n Behind   O, I am slain! \\n \\n\\n\\n Falls and dies \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n O me, what hast thou done? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nay, I know not: \\n Is it the king? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n O, what a rash and bloody deed is this! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother, \\n As kill a king, and marry with his brother. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n As kill a king! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, lady, 'twas my word. \\n Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS \\n Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! \\n I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune; \\n Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. \\n Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down, \\n And let me wring your heart; for so I shall, \\n If it be made of penetrable stuff, \\n If damned custom have not brass'd it so \\n That it is proof and bulwark against sense. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue \\n In noise so rude against me? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Such an act \\n That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, \\n Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose \\n From the fair forehead of an innocent love \\n And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows \\n As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed \\n As from the body of contraction plucks \\n The very soul, and sweet religion makes \\n A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow: \\n Yea, this solidity and compound mass, \\n With tristful visage, as against the doom, \\n Is thought-sick at the act. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Ay me, what act, \\n That roars so loud, and thunders in the index? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Look here, upon this picture, and on this, \\n The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. \\n See, what a grace was seated on this brow; \\n Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself; \\n An eye like Mars, to threaten and command; \\n A station like the herald Mercury \\n New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill; \\n A combination and a form indeed, \\n Where every god did seem to set his seal, \\n To give the world assurance of a man: \\n This was your husband. Look you now, what follows: \\n Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear, \\n Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? \\n Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, \\n And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes? \\n You cannot call it love; for at your age \\n The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, \\n And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment \\n Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have, \\n Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense \\n Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, \\n Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd \\n But it reserved some quantity of choice, \\n To serve in such a difference. What devil was't \\n That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind? \\n Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, \\n Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, \\n Or but a sickly part of one true sense \\n Could not so mope. \\n O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, \\n If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, \\n To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, \\n And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame \\n When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, \\n Since frost itself as actively doth burn \\n And reason panders will. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n O Hamlet, speak no more: \\n Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; \\n And there I see such black and grained spots \\n As will not leave their tinct. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nay, but to live \\n In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, \\n Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love \\n Over the nasty sty,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n O, speak to me no more; \\n These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears; \\n No more, sweet Hamlet! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n A murderer and a villain; \\n A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe \\n Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; \\n A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, \\n That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, \\n And put it in his pocket! \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n No more! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n A king of shreds and patches,-- \\n Enter Ghost \\n Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, \\n You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Alas, he's mad! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Do you not come your tardy son to chide, \\n That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by \\n The important acting of your dread command? O, say! \\n \\n\\n \\n Ghost \\n Do not forget: this visitation \\n Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. \\n But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: \\n O, step between her and her fighting soul: \\n Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works: \\n Speak to her, Hamlet. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How is it with you, lady? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Alas, how is't with you, \\n That you do bend your eye on vacancy \\n And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? \\n Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; \\n And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, \\n Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, \\n Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son, \\n Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper \\n Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares! \\n His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, \\n Would make them capable. Do not look upon me; \\n Lest with this piteous action you convert \\n My stern effects: then what I have to do \\n Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n To whom do you speak this? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Do you see nothing there? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Nothing at all; yet all that is I see. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nor did you nothing hear? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n No, nothing but ourselves. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, look you there! look, how it steals away! \\n My father, in his habit as he lived! \\n Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Ghost \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n This the very coinage of your brain: \\n This bodiless creation ecstasy \\n Is very cunning in. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ecstasy! \\n My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, \\n And makes as healthful music: it is not madness \\n That I have utter'd: bring me to the test, \\n And I the matter will re-word; which madness \\n Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, \\n Lay not that mattering unction to your soul, \\n That not your trespass, but my madness speaks: \\n It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, \\n Whilst rank corruption, mining all within, \\n Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven; \\n Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; \\n And do not spread the compost on the weeds, \\n To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; \\n For in the fatness of these pursy times \\n Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, \\n Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O, throw away the worser part of it, \\n And live the purer with the other half. \\n Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed; \\n Assume a virtue, if you have it not. \\n That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat, \\n Of habits devil, is angel yet in this, \\n That to the use of actions fair and good \\n He likewise gives a frock or livery, \\n That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night, \\n And that shall lend a kind of easiness \\n To the next abstinence: the next more easy; \\n For use almost can change the stamp of nature, \\n And either ... the devil, or throw him out \\n With wondrous potency. Once more, good night: \\n And when you are desirous to be bless'd, \\n I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord, \\n Pointing to POLONIUS \\n I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so, \\n To punish me with this and this with me, \\n That I must be their scourge and minister. \\n I will bestow him, and will answer well \\n The death I gave him. So, again, good night. \\n I must be cruel, only to be kind: \\n Thus bad begins and worse remains behind. \\n One word more, good lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n What shall I do? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: \\n Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed; \\n Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; \\n And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, \\n Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers, \\n Make you to ravel all this matter out, \\n That I essentially am not in madness, \\n But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know; \\n For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, \\n Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, \\n Such dear concernings hide? who would do so? \\n No, in despite of sense and secrecy, \\n Unpeg the basket on the house's top. \\n Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape, \\n To try conclusions, in the basket creep, \\n And break your own neck down. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Be thou assured, if words be made of breath, \\n And breath of life, I have no life to breathe \\n What thou hast said to me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I must to England; you know that? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Alack, \\n I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, \\n Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd, \\n They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way, \\n And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; \\n For 'tis the sport to have the engineer \\n Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard \\n But I will delve one yard below their mines, \\n And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet, \\n When in one line two crafts directly meet. \\n This man shall set me packing: \\n I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. \\n Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor \\n Is now most still, most secret and most grave, \\n Who was in life a foolish prating knave. \\n Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. \\n Good night, mother. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT IV \\n\\n SCENE I.  A room in the castle. \\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,\\nand GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves: \\n You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them. \\n Where is your son? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Bestow this place on us a little while. \\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night! \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend \\n Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit, \\n Behind the arras hearing something stir, \\n Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!' \\n And, in this brainish apprehension, kills \\n The unseen good old man. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n O heavy deed! \\n It had been so with us, had we been there: \\n His liberty is full of threats to all; \\n To you yourself, to us, to every one. \\n Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd? \\n It will be laid to us, whose providence \\n Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt, \\n This mad young man: but so much was our love, \\n We would not understand what was most fit; \\n But, like the owner of a foul disease, \\n To keep it from divulging, let it feed \\n Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n To draw apart the body he hath kill'd: \\n O'er whom his very madness, like some ore \\n Among a mineral of metals base, \\n Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n O Gertrude, come away! \\n The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch, \\n But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed \\n We must, with all our majesty and skill, \\n Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern! \\n Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n Friends both, go join you with some further aid: \\n Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, \\n And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him: \\n Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body \\n Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this. \\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends; \\n And let them know, both what we mean to do, \\n And what's untimely done... \\n Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, \\n As level as the cannon to his blank, \\n Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name, \\n And hit the woundless air. O, come away! \\n My soul is full of discord and dismay. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Another room in the castle. \\n Enter HAMLET \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Safely stowed. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n Within   Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What noise? who calls on Hamlet? \\n O, here they come. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n What have you done, my lord, with the dead body? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence \\n And bear it to the chapel. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Do not believe it. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Believe what? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. \\n Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what \\n replication should be made by the son of a king? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Take you me for a sponge, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his \\n rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the \\n king best service in the end: he keeps them, like \\n an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to \\n be last swallowed: when he needs what you have \\n gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you \\n shall be dry again. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n I understand you not, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a \\n foolish ear. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go \\n with us to the king. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The body is with the king, but the king is not with \\n the body. The king is a thing-- \\n \\n\\n \\n GUILDENSTERN \\n A thing, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Another room in the castle. \\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n I have sent to seek him, and to find the body. \\n How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! \\n Yet must not we put the strong law on him: \\n He's loved of the distracted multitude, \\n Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; \\n And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, \\n But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, \\n This sudden sending him away must seem \\n Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown \\n By desperate appliance are relieved, \\n Or not at all. \\n Enter ROSENCRANTZ \\n How now! what hath befall'n? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, \\n We cannot get from him. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n But where is he? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Bring him before us. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n At supper. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n At supper! where? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain \\n convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your \\n worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all \\n creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for \\n maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but \\n variable service, two dishes, but to one table: \\n that's the end. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Alas, alas! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a \\n king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n What dost you mean by this? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nothing but to show you how a king may go a \\n progress through the guts of a beggar. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Where is Polonius? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger \\n find him not there, seek him i' the other place \\n yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within \\n this month, you shall nose him as you go up the \\n stairs into the lobby. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Go seek him there. \\n \\n\\n\\n To some Attendants \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n He will stay till ye come. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Attendants \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-- \\n Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve \\n For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence \\n With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself; \\n The bark is ready, and the wind at help, \\n The associates tend, and every thing is bent \\n For England. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n For England! \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Ay, Hamlet. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Good. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for \\n England! Farewell, dear mother. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Thy loving father, Hamlet. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man \\n and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard; \\n Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night: \\n Away! for every thing is seal'd and done \\n That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste. \\n Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN \\n And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught-- \\n As my great power thereof may give thee sense, \\n Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red \\n After the Danish sword, and thy free awe \\n Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set \\n Our sovereign process; which imports at full, \\n By letters congruing to that effect, \\n The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; \\n For like the hectic in my blood he rages, \\n And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done, \\n Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  A plain in Denmark. \\n Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching \\n\\n \\n PRINCE FORTINBRAS \\n Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king; \\n Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras \\n Craves the conveyance of a promised march \\n Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous. \\n If that his majesty would aught with us, \\n We shall express our duty in his eye; \\n And let him know so. \\n \\n\\n \\n Captain \\n I will do't, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE FORTINBRAS \\n Go softly on. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers \\n Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Good sir, whose powers are these? \\n \\n\\n \\n Captain \\n They are of Norway, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How purposed, sir, I pray you? \\n \\n\\n \\n Captain \\n Against some part of Poland. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Who commands them, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n Captain \\n The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, \\n Or for some frontier? \\n \\n\\n \\n Captain \\n Truly to speak, and with no addition, \\n We go to gain a little patch of ground \\n That hath in it no profit but the name. \\n To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; \\n Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole \\n A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, then the Polack never will defend it. \\n \\n\\n \\n Captain \\n Yes, it is already garrison'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats \\n Will not debate the question of this straw: \\n This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, \\n That inward breaks, and shows no cause without \\n Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n Captain \\n God be wi' you, sir. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n ROSENCRANTZ \\n Wilt please you go, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I'll be with you straight go a little before. \\n Exeunt all except HAMLET \\n How all occasions do inform against me, \\n And spur my dull revenge! What is a man, \\n If his chief good and market of his time \\n Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more. \\n Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, \\n Looking before and after, gave us not \\n That capability and god-like reason \\n To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be \\n Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple \\n Of thinking too precisely on the event, \\n A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom \\n And ever three parts coward, I do not know \\n Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;' \\n Sith I have cause and will and strength and means \\n To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me: \\n Witness this army of such mass and charge \\n Led by a delicate and tender prince, \\n Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd \\n Makes mouths at the invisible event, \\n Exposing what is mortal and unsure \\n To all that fortune, death and danger dare, \\n Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great \\n Is not to stir without great argument, \\n But greatly to find quarrel in a straw \\n When honour's at the stake. How stand I then, \\n That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, \\n Excitements of my reason and my blood, \\n And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see \\n The imminent death of twenty thousand men, \\n That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, \\n Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot \\n Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, \\n Which is not tomb enough and continent \\n To hide the slain? O, from this time forth, \\n My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Elsinore. A room in the castle. \\n Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n I will not speak with her. \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentleman \\n She is importunate, indeed distract: \\n Her mood will needs be pitied. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n What would she have? \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentleman \\n She speaks much of her father; says she hears \\n There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart; \\n Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, \\n That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing, \\n Yet the unshaped use of it doth move \\n The hearers to collection; they aim at it, \\n And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; \\n Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures \\n yield them, \\n Indeed would make one think there might be thought, \\n Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew \\n Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Let her come in. \\n Exit HORATIO \\n To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is, \\n Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss: \\n So full of artless jealousy is guilt, \\n It spills itself in fearing to be spilt. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n How now, Ophelia! \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Sings \\n How should I your true love know \\n From another one? \\n By his cockle hat and staff, \\n And his sandal shoon. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Say you? nay, pray you, mark. \\n Sings \\n He is dead and gone, lady, \\n He is dead and gone; \\n At his head a grass-green turf, \\n At his heels a stone. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Nay, but, Ophelia,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Pray you, mark. \\n Sings \\n White his shroud as the mountain snow,-- \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Alas, look here, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Sings \\n Larded with sweet flowers \\n Which bewept to the grave did go \\n With true-love showers. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n How do you, pretty lady? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's \\n daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not \\n what we may be. God be at your table! \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Conceit upon her father. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they \\n ask you what it means, say you this: \\n Sings \\n To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day, \\n All in the morning betime, \\n And I a maid at your window, \\n To be your Valentine. \\n Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes, \\n And dupp'd the chamber-door; \\n Let in the maid, that out a maid \\n Never departed more. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Pretty Ophelia! \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't: \\n Sings \\n By Gis and by Saint Charity, \\n Alack, and fie for shame! \\n Young men will do't, if they come to't; \\n By cock, they are to blame. \\n Quoth she, before you tumbled me, \\n You promised me to wed. \\n So would I ha' done, by yonder sun, \\n An thou hadst not come to my bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n How long hath she been thus? \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I \\n cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him \\n i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it: \\n and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my \\n coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; \\n good night, good night. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Follow her close; give her good watch, \\n I pray you. \\n Exit HORATIO \\n O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs \\n All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude, \\n When sorrows come, they come not single spies \\n But in battalions. First, her father slain: \\n Next, your son gone; and he most violent author \\n Of his own just remove: the people muddied, \\n Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers, \\n For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly, \\n In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia \\n Divided from herself and her fair judgment, \\n Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts: \\n Last, and as much containing as all these, \\n Her brother is in secret come from France; \\n Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds, \\n And wants not buzzers to infect his ear \\n With pestilent speeches of his father's death; \\n Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd, \\n Will nothing stick our person to arraign \\n In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this, \\n Like to a murdering-piece, in many places \\n Gives me superfluous death. \\n \\n\\n\\n A noise within \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Alack, what noise is this? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. \\n Enter another Gentleman \\n What is the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentleman \\n Save yourself, my lord: \\n The ocean, overpeering of his list, \\n Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste \\n Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, \\n O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord; \\n And, as the world were now but to begin, \\n Antiquity forgot, custom not known, \\n The ratifiers and props of every word, \\n They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:' \\n Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds: \\n 'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!' \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n How cheerfully on the false trail they cry! \\n O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs! \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n The doors are broke. \\n \\n\\n Noise within \\n Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without. \\n \\n\\n \\n Danes \\n No, let's come in. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n I pray you, give me leave. \\n \\n\\n \\n Danes \\n We will, we will. \\n \\n\\n\\n They retire without the door \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king, \\n Give me my father! \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Calmly, good Laertes. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard, \\n Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot \\n Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow \\n Of my true mother. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n What is the cause, Laertes, \\n That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? \\n Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person: \\n There's such divinity doth hedge a king, \\n That treason can but peep to what it would, \\n Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes, \\n Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude. \\n Speak, man. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Where is my father? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n But not by him. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Let him demand his fill. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with: \\n To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil! \\n Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! \\n I dare damnation. To this point I stand, \\n That both the worlds I give to negligence, \\n Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged \\n Most thoroughly for my father. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Who shall stay you? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n My will, not all the world: \\n And for my means, I'll husband them so well, \\n They shall go far with little. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Good Laertes, \\n If you desire to know the certainty \\n Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge, \\n That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, \\n Winner and loser? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n None but his enemies. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Will you know them then? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms; \\n And like the kind life-rendering pelican, \\n Repast them with my blood. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Why, now you speak \\n Like a good child and a true gentleman. \\n That I am guiltless of your father's death, \\n And am most sensible in grief for it, \\n It shall as level to your judgment pierce \\n As day does to your eye. \\n \\n\\n \\n Danes \\n Within                 Let her come in. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n How now! what noise is that? \\n Re-enter OPHELIA \\n O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt, \\n Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye! \\n By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, \\n Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! \\n Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! \\n O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits \\n Should be as moral as an old man's life? \\n Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine, \\n It sends some precious instance of itself \\n After the thing it loves. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Sings \\n They bore him barefaced on the bier; \\n Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny; \\n And in his grave rain'd many a tear:-- \\n Fare you well, my dove! \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, \\n It could not move thus. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Sings \\n You must sing a-down a-down, \\n An you call him a-down-a. \\n O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false \\n steward, that stole his master's daughter. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n This nothing's more than matter. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, \\n love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue \\n for you; and here's some for me: we may call it \\n herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with \\n a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you \\n some violets, but they withered all when my father \\n died: they say he made a good end,-- \\n Sings \\n For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, \\n She turns to favour and to prettiness. \\n \\n\\n \\n OPHELIA \\n Sings \\n And will he not come again? \\n And will he not come again? \\n No, no, he is dead: \\n Go to thy death-bed: \\n He never will come again. \\n His beard was as white as snow, \\n All flaxen was his poll: \\n He is gone, he is gone, \\n And we cast away moan: \\n God ha' mercy on his soul! \\n And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Do you see this, O God? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Laertes, I must commune with your grief, \\n Or you deny me right. Go but apart, \\n Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will. \\n And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me: \\n If by direct or by collateral hand \\n They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give, \\n Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours, \\n To you in satisfaction; but if not, \\n Be you content to lend your patience to us, \\n And we shall jointly labour with your soul \\n To give it due content. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Let this be so; \\n His means of death, his obscure funeral-- \\n No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, \\n No noble rite nor formal ostentation-- \\n Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, \\n That I must call't in question. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n So you shall; \\n And where the offence is let the great axe fall. \\n I pray you, go with me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Another room in the castle. \\n Enter HORATIO and a Servant \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n What are they that would speak with me? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Let them come in. \\n Exit Servant \\n I do not know from what part of the world \\n I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Sailors \\n\\n \\n First Sailor \\n God bless you, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Let him bless thee too. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Sailor \\n He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for \\n you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was \\n bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am \\n let to know it is. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Reads   'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked \\n this, give these fellows some means to the king: \\n they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old \\n at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us \\n chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on \\n a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded \\n them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so \\n I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with \\n me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they \\n did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king \\n have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me \\n with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I \\n have words to speak in thine ear will make thee \\n dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of \\n the matter. These good fellows will bring thee \\n where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their \\n course for England: of them I have much to tell \\n thee. Farewell. \\n 'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.' \\n Come, I will make you way for these your letters; \\n And do't the speedier, that you may direct me \\n To him from whom you brought them. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VII.  Another room in the castle. \\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, \\n And you must put me in your heart for friend, \\n Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, \\n That he which hath your noble father slain \\n Pursued my life. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n It well appears: but tell me \\n Why you proceeded not against these feats, \\n So crimeful and so capital in nature, \\n As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, \\n You mainly were stirr'd up. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n O, for two special reasons; \\n Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, \\n But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother \\n Lives almost by his looks; and for myself-- \\n My virtue or my plague, be it either which-- \\n She's so conjunctive to my life and soul, \\n That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, \\n I could not but by her. The other motive, \\n Why to a public count I might not go, \\n Is the great love the general gender bear him; \\n Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, \\n Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, \\n Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, \\n Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind, \\n Would have reverted to my bow again, \\n And not where I had aim'd them. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n And so have I a noble father lost; \\n A sister driven into desperate terms, \\n Whose worth, if praises may go back again, \\n Stood challenger on mount of all the age \\n For her perfections: but my revenge will come. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think \\n That we are made of stuff so flat and dull \\n That we can let our beard be shook with danger \\n And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more: \\n I loved your father, and we love ourself; \\n And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-- \\n Enter a Messenger \\n How now! what news? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Letters, my lord, from Hamlet: \\n This to your majesty; this to the queen. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n From Hamlet! who brought them? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not: \\n They were given me by Claudio; he received them \\n Of him that brought them. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. \\n Exit Messenger \\n Reads \\n 'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on \\n your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see \\n your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your \\n pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden \\n and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.' \\n What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? \\n Or is it some abuse, and no such thing? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Know you the hand? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n 'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked! \\n And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.' \\n Can you advise me? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come; \\n It warms the very sickness in my heart, \\n That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, \\n 'Thus didest thou.' \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n If it be so, Laertes-- \\n As how should it be so? how otherwise?-- \\n Will you be ruled by me? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Ay, my lord; \\n So you will not o'errule me to a peace. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n To thine own peace. If he be now return'd, \\n As checking at his voyage, and that he means \\n No more to undertake it, I will work him \\n To an exploit, now ripe in my device, \\n Under the which he shall not choose but fall: \\n And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, \\n But even his mother shall uncharge the practise \\n And call it accident. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n My lord, I will be ruled; \\n The rather, if you could devise it so \\n That I might be the organ. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n It falls right. \\n You have been talk'd of since your travel much, \\n And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality \\n Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts \\n Did not together pluck such envy from him \\n As did that one, and that, in my regard, \\n Of the unworthiest siege. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n What part is that, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n A very riband in the cap of youth, \\n Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes \\n The light and careless livery that it wears \\n Than settled age his sables and his weeds, \\n Importing health and graveness. Two months since, \\n Here was a gentleman of Normandy:-- \\n I've seen myself, and served against, the French, \\n And they can well on horseback: but this gallant \\n Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat; \\n And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, \\n As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured \\n With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought, \\n That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, \\n Come short of what he did. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n A Norman was't? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n A Norman. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Upon my life, Lamond. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n The very same. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n I know him well: he is the brooch indeed \\n And gem of all the nation. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n He made confession of you, \\n And gave you such a masterly report \\n For art and exercise in your defence \\n And for your rapier most especially, \\n That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed, \\n If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, \\n He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye, \\n If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his \\n Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy \\n That he could nothing do but wish and beg \\n Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him. \\n Now, out of this,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n What out of this, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Laertes, was your father dear to you? \\n Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, \\n A face without a heart? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Why ask you this? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Not that I think you did not love your father; \\n But that I know love is begun by time; \\n And that I see, in passages of proof, \\n Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. \\n There lives within the very flame of love \\n A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; \\n And nothing is at a like goodness still; \\n For goodness, growing to a plurisy, \\n Dies in his own too much: that we would do \\n We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes \\n And hath abatements and delays as many \\n As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; \\n And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, \\n That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:-- \\n Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake, \\n To show yourself your father's son in deed \\n More than in words? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n To cut his throat i' the church. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; \\n Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, \\n Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. \\n Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home: \\n We'll put on those shall praise your excellence \\n And set a double varnish on the fame \\n The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together \\n And wager on your heads: he, being remiss, \\n Most generous and free from all contriving, \\n Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease, \\n Or with a little shuffling, you may choose \\n A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise \\n Requite him for your father. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n I will do't: \\n And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword. \\n I bought an unction of a mountebank, \\n So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, \\n Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, \\n Collected from all simples that have virtue \\n Under the moon, can save the thing from death \\n That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point \\n With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, \\n It may be death. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Let's further think of this; \\n Weigh what convenience both of time and means \\n May fit us to our shape: if this should fail, \\n And that our drift look through our bad performance, \\n 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project \\n Should have a back or second, that might hold, \\n If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see: \\n We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't. \\n When in your motion you are hot and dry-- \\n As make your bouts more violent to that end-- \\n And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him \\n A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, \\n If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, \\n Our purpose may hold there. \\n Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n How now, sweet queen! \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n One woe doth tread upon another's heel, \\n So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Drown'd! O, where? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n There is a willow grows aslant a brook, \\n That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; \\n There with fantastic garlands did she come \\n Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples \\n That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, \\n But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them: \\n There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds \\n Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke; \\n When down her weedy trophies and herself \\n Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide; \\n And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up: \\n Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes; \\n As one incapable of her own distress, \\n Or like a creature native and indued \\n Unto that element: but long it could not be \\n Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, \\n Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay \\n To muddy death. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Alas, then, she is drown'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Drown'd, drown'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, \\n And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet \\n It is our trick; nature her custom holds, \\n Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, \\n The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord: \\n I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, \\n But that this folly douts it. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Let's follow, Gertrude: \\n How much I had to do to calm his rage! \\n Now fear I this will give it start again; \\n Therefore let's follow. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT V \\n\\n SCENE I.  A churchyard. \\n Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Is she to be buried in Christian burial that \\n wilfully seeks her own salvation? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave \\n straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it \\n Christian burial. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her \\n own defence? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Why, 'tis found so. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For \\n here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly, \\n it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it \\n is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned \\n herself wittingly. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here \\n stands the man; good; if the man go to this water, \\n and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he \\n goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him \\n and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he \\n that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n But is this law? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been \\n a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' \\n Christian burial. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that \\n great folk should have countenance in this world to \\n drown or hang themselves, more than their even \\n Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient \\n gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: \\n they hold up Adam's profession. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Was he a gentleman? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n He was the first that ever bore arms. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Why, he had none. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the \\n Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:' \\n could he dig without arms? I'll put another \\n question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the \\n purpose, confess thyself-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Go to. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n What is he that builds stronger than either the \\n mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a \\n thousand tenants. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows \\n does well; but how does it well? it does well to \\n those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the \\n gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, \\n the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n 'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or \\n a carpenter?' \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Ay, tell me that, and unyoke. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Marry, now I can tell. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n To't. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Clown \\n Mass, I cannot tell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull \\n ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when \\n you are asked this question next, say 'a \\n grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till \\n doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a \\n stoup of liquor. \\n Exit Second Clown \\n He digs and sings \\n In youth, when I did love, did love, \\n Methought it was very sweet, \\n To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove, \\n O, methought, there was nothing meet. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he \\n sings at grave-making? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath \\n the daintier sense. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Sings \\n But age, with his stealing steps, \\n Hath claw'd me in his clutch, \\n And hath shipped me intil the land, \\n As if I had never been such. \\n \\n\\n\\n Throws up a skull \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: \\n how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were \\n Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It \\n might be the pate of a politician, which this ass \\n now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God, \\n might it not? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n It might, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow, \\n sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might \\n be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord \\n such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Ay, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and \\n knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade: \\n here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to \\n see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, \\n but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Sings \\n A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade, \\n For and a shrouding sheet: \\n O, a pit of clay for to be made \\n For such a guest is meet. \\n \\n\\n\\n Throws up another skull \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n There's another: why may not that be the skull of a \\n lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, \\n his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he \\n suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the \\n sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of \\n his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be \\n in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, \\n his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, \\n his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and \\n the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine \\n pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him \\n no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than \\n the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The \\n very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in \\n this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Not a jot more, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Is not parchment made of sheepskins? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance \\n in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose \\n grave's this, sirrah? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Mine, sir. \\n Sings \\n O, a pit of clay for to be made \\n For such a guest is meet. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not \\n yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n 'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: \\n 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to \\n you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What man dost thou dig it for? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n For no man, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What woman, then? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n For none, neither. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Who is to be buried in't? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the \\n card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, \\n Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of \\n it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the \\n peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he \\n gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a \\n grave-maker? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day \\n that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How long is that since? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it \\n was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that \\n is mad, and sent into England. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits \\n there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n 'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men \\n are as mad as he. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How came he mad? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Very strangely, they say. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How strangely? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Faith, e'en with losing his wits. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Upon what ground? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man \\n and boy, thirty years. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we \\n have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce \\n hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year \\n or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why he more than another? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that \\n he will keep out water a great while; and your water \\n is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. \\n Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth \\n three and twenty years. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Whose was it? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nay, I know not. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a \\n flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, \\n sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n This? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Clown \\n E'en that. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Let me see. \\n Takes the skull \\n Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow \\n of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath \\n borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how \\n abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at \\n it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know \\n not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your \\n gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, \\n that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one \\n now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? \\n Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let \\n her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must \\n come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell \\n me one thing. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n What's that, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' \\n the earth? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n E'en so. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n And smelt so? pah! \\n \\n\\n\\n Puts down the skull \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n E'en so, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may \\n not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, \\n till he find it stopping a bung-hole? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with \\n modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as \\n thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, \\n Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of \\n earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he \\n was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel? \\n Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, \\n Might stop a hole to keep the wind away: \\n O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, \\n Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw! \\n But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king. \\n Enter Priest, &c. in procession; the Corpse of\\nOPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING\\nCLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, &c \\n The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow? \\n And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken \\n The corse they follow did with desperate hand \\n Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate. \\n Couch we awhile, and mark. \\n \\n\\n\\n Retiring with HORATIO \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n What ceremony else? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n That is Laertes, \\n A very noble youth: mark. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n What ceremony else? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Priest \\n Her obsequies have been as far enlarged \\n As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful; \\n And, but that great command o'ersways the order, \\n She should in ground unsanctified have lodged \\n Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers, \\n Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her; \\n Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants, \\n Her maiden strewments and the bringing home \\n Of bell and burial. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Must there no more be done? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Priest \\n No more be done: \\n We should profane the service of the dead \\n To sing a requiem and such rest to her \\n As to peace-parted souls. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Lay her i' the earth: \\n And from her fair and unpolluted flesh \\n May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest, \\n A ministering angel shall my sister be, \\n When thou liest howling. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What, the fair Ophelia! \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Sweets to the sweet: farewell! \\n Scattering flowers \\n I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; \\n I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid, \\n And not have strew'd thy grave. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n O, treble woe \\n Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, \\n Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense \\n Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile, \\n Till I have caught her once more in mine arms: \\n Leaps into the grave \\n Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, \\n Till of this flat a mountain you have made, \\n To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head \\n Of blue Olympus. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Advancing      What is he whose grief \\n Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow \\n Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand \\n Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, \\n Hamlet the Dane. \\n \\n\\n\\n Leaps into the grave \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n The devil take thy soul! \\n \\n\\n\\n Grappling with him \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Thou pray'st not well. \\n I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; \\n For, though I am not splenitive and rash, \\n Yet have I something in me dangerous, \\n Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Pluck them asunder. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Hamlet, Hamlet! \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Gentlemen,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Good my lord, be quiet. \\n \\n\\n\\n The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why I will fight with him upon this theme \\n Until my eyelids will no longer wag. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n O my son, what theme? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers \\n Could not, with all their quantity of love, \\n Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n O, he is mad, Laertes. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n For love of God, forbear him. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do: \\n Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself? \\n Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? \\n I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine? \\n To outface me with leaping in her grave? \\n Be buried quick with her, and so will I: \\n And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw \\n Millions of acres on us, till our ground, \\n Singeing his pate against the burning zone, \\n Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, \\n I'll rant as well as thou. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n This is mere madness: \\n And thus awhile the fit will work on him; \\n Anon, as patient as the female dove, \\n When that her golden couplets are disclosed, \\n His silence will sit drooping. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Hear you, sir; \\n What is the reason that you use me thus? \\n I loved you ever: but it is no matter; \\n Let Hercules himself do what he may, \\n The cat will mew and dog will have his day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him. \\n Exit HORATIO \\n To LAERTES \\n Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech; \\n We'll put the matter to the present push. \\n Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. \\n This grave shall have a living monument: \\n An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; \\n Till then, in patience our proceeding be. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A hall in the castle. \\n Enter HAMLET and HORATIO \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; \\n You do remember all the circumstance? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Remember it, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, \\n That would not let me sleep: methought I lay \\n Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, \\n And praised be rashness for it, let us know, \\n Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, \\n When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us \\n There's a divinity that shapes our ends, \\n Rough-hew them how we will,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n That is most certain. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Up from my cabin, \\n My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark \\n Groped I to find out them; had my desire. \\n Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew \\n To mine own room again; making so bold, \\n My fears forgetting manners, to unseal \\n Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,-- \\n O royal knavery!--an exact command, \\n Larded with many several sorts of reasons \\n Importing Denmark's health and England's too, \\n With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, \\n That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, \\n No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, \\n My head should be struck off. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Is't possible? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Here's the commission: read it at more leisure. \\n But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n I beseech you. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Being thus be-netted round with villanies,-- \\n Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, \\n They had begun the play--I sat me down, \\n Devised a new commission, wrote it fair: \\n I once did hold it, as our statists do, \\n A baseness to write fair and labour'd much \\n How to forget that learning, but, sir, now \\n It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know \\n The effect of what I wrote? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Ay, good my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n An earnest conjuration from the king, \\n As England was his faithful tributary, \\n As love between them like the palm might flourish, \\n As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear \\n And stand a comma 'tween their amities, \\n And many such-like 'As'es of great charge, \\n That, on the view and knowing of these contents, \\n Without debatement further, more or less, \\n He should the bearers put to sudden death, \\n Not shriving-time allow'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n How was this seal'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. \\n I had my father's signet in my purse, \\n Which was the model of that Danish seal; \\n Folded the writ up in form of the other, \\n Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely, \\n The changeling never known. Now, the next day \\n Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent \\n Thou know'st already. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Why, man, they did make love to this employment; \\n They are not near my conscience; their defeat \\n Does by their own insinuation grow: \\n 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes \\n Between the pass and fell incensed points \\n Of mighty opposites. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Why, what a king is this! \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon-- \\n He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother, \\n Popp'd in between the election and my hopes, \\n Thrown out his angle for my proper life, \\n And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience, \\n To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd, \\n To let this canker of our nature come \\n In further evil? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n It must be shortly known to him from England \\n What is the issue of the business there. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It will be short: the interim is mine; \\n And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.' \\n But I am very sorry, good Horatio, \\n That to Laertes I forgot myself; \\n For, by the image of my cause, I see \\n The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours. \\n But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me \\n Into a towering passion. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Peace! who comes here? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter OSRIC \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n No, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to \\n know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a \\n beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at \\n the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say, \\n spacious in the possession of dirt. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I \\n should impart a thing to you from his majesty. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of \\n spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n I thank your lordship, it is very hot. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is \\n northerly. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my \\n complexion. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as \\n 'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his \\n majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a \\n great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I beseech you, remember-- \\n \\n\\n\\n HAMLET moves him to put on his hat \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. \\n Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe \\n me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent \\n differences, of very soft society and great showing: \\n indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or \\n calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the \\n continent of what part a gentleman would see. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; \\n though, I know, to divide him inventorially would \\n dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw \\n neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the \\n verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of \\n great article; and his infusion of such dearth and \\n rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his \\n semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace \\n him, his umbrage, nothing more. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman \\n in our more rawer breath? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? \\n You will do't, sir, really. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What imports the nomination of this gentleman? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Of Laertes? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Of him, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n I know you are not ignorant-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, \\n it would not much approve me. Well, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with \\n him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to \\n know himself. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation \\n laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What's his weapon? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Rapier and dagger. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n That's two of his weapons: but, well. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary \\n horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take \\n it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their \\n assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the \\n carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very \\n responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, \\n and of very liberal conceit. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n What call you the carriages? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n The carriages, sir, are the hangers. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we \\n could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might \\n be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses \\n against six French swords, their assigns, and three \\n liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet \\n against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes \\n between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you \\n three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it \\n would come to immediate trial, if your lordship \\n would vouchsafe the answer. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How if I answer 'no'? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his \\n majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let \\n the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the \\n king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; \\n if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Shall I re-deliver you e'en so? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n I commend my duty to your lordship. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Yours, yours. \\n Exit OSRIC \\n He does well to commend it himself; there are no \\n tongues else for's turn. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it. \\n Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I \\n know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of \\n the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of \\n yesty collection, which carries them through and \\n through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do \\n but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Lord \\n\\n \\n Lord \\n My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young \\n Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in \\n the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to \\n play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's \\n pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now \\n or whensoever, provided I be so able as now. \\n \\n\\n \\n Lord \\n The king and queen and all are coming down. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n In happy time. \\n \\n\\n \\n Lord \\n The queen desires you to use some gentle \\n entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n She well instructs me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Lord \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n You will lose this wager, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I do not think so: since he went into France, I \\n have been in continual practise: I shall win at the \\n odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here \\n about my heart: but it is no matter. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Nay, good my lord,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of \\n gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will \\n forestall their repair hither, and say you are not \\n fit. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special \\n providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, \\n 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be \\n now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the \\n readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he \\n leaves, what is't to leave betimes? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES,\\nLords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &c \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. \\n \\n\\n\\n KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong; \\n But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. \\n This presence knows, \\n And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd \\n With sore distraction. What I have done, \\n That might your nature, honour and exception \\n Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. \\n Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet: \\n If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, \\n And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, \\n Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. \\n Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so, \\n Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; \\n His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. \\n Sir, in this audience, \\n Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil \\n Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, \\n That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house, \\n And hurt my brother. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n I am satisfied in nature, \\n Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most \\n To my revenge: but in my terms of honour \\n I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement, \\n Till by some elder masters, of known honour, \\n I have a voice and precedent of peace, \\n To keep my name ungored. But till that time, \\n I do receive your offer'd love like love, \\n And will not wrong it. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I embrace it freely; \\n And will this brother's wager frankly play. \\n Give us the foils. Come on. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Come, one for me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance \\n Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, \\n Stick fiery off indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n You mock me, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n No, by this hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, \\n You know the wager? \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Very well, my lord \\n Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n I do not fear it; I have seen you both: \\n But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n This is too heavy, let me see another. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n This likes me well. These foils have all a length? \\n \\n\\n\\n They prepare to play \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Ay, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Set me the stoops of wine upon that table. \\n If Hamlet give the first or second hit, \\n Or quit in answer of the third exchange, \\n Let all the battlements their ordnance fire: \\n The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; \\n And in the cup an union shall he throw, \\n Richer than that which four successive kings \\n In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; \\n And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, \\n The trumpet to the cannoneer without, \\n The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, \\n 'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin: \\n And you, the judges, bear a wary eye. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Come on, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Come, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n They play \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n One. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n No. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Judgment. \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n A hit, a very palpable hit. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Well; again. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; \\n Here's to thy health. \\n Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within \\n Give him the cup. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. \\n They play \\n Another hit; what say you? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n A touch, a touch, I do confess. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Our son shall win. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n He's fat, and scant of breath. \\n Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows; \\n The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Good madam! \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Gertrude, do not drink. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Aside   It is the poison'd cup: it is too late. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n Come, let me wipe thy face. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n My lord, I'll hit him now. \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n I do not think't. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Aside   And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally; \\n I pray you, pass with your best violence; \\n I am afeard you make a wanton of me. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Say you so? come on. \\n \\n\\n\\n They play \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Nothing, neither way. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Have at you now! \\n \\n\\n\\n LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they\\nchange rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n Part them; they are incensed. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Nay, come, again. \\n \\n\\n\\n QUEEN GERTRUDE falls \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Look to the queen there, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n How is't, Laertes? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric; \\n I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n How does the queen? \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n She swounds to see them bleed. \\n \\n\\n \\n QUEEN GERTRUDE \\n No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,-- \\n The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd: \\n Treachery! Seek it out. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; \\n No medicine in the world can do thee good; \\n In thee there is not half an hour of life; \\n The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, \\n Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise \\n Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie, \\n Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: \\n I can no more: the king, the king's to blame. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n The point!--envenom'd too! \\n Then, venom, to thy work. \\n \\n\\n\\n Stabs KING CLAUDIUS \\n\\n \\n All \\n Treason! treason! \\n \\n\\n \\n KING CLAUDIUS \\n O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, \\n Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? \\n Follow my mother. \\n \\n\\n\\n KING CLAUDIUS dies \\n\\n \\n LAERTES \\n He is justly served; \\n It is a poison temper'd by himself. \\n Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: \\n Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, \\n Nor thine on me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. \\n I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! \\n You that look pale and tremble at this chance, \\n That are but mutes or audience to this act, \\n Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, \\n Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you-- \\n But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; \\n Thou livest; report me and my cause aright \\n To the unsatisfied. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Never believe it: \\n I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: \\n Here's yet some liquor left. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n As thou'rt a man, \\n Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't. \\n O good Horatio, what a wounded name, \\n Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me! \\n If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart \\n Absent thee from felicity awhile, \\n And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, \\n To tell my story. \\n March afar off, and shot within \\n What warlike noise is this? \\n \\n\\n \\n OSRIC \\n Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, \\n To the ambassadors of England gives \\n This warlike volley. \\n \\n\\n \\n HAMLET \\n O, I die, Horatio; \\n The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit: \\n I cannot live to hear the news from England; \\n But I do prophesy the election lights \\n On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; \\n So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, \\n Which have solicited. The rest is silence. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince: \\n And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! \\n Why does the drum come hither? \\n \\n\\n March within \\n Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,\\nand others \\n\\n \\n PRINCE FORTINBRAS \\n Where is this sight? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n What is it ye would see? \\n If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE FORTINBRAS \\n This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, \\n What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, \\n That thou so many princes at a shot \\n So bloodily hast struck? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Ambassador \\n The sight is dismal; \\n And our affairs from England come too late: \\n The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, \\n To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd, \\n That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: \\n Where should we have our thanks? \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Not from his mouth, \\n Had it the ability of life to thank you: \\n He never gave commandment for their death. \\n But since, so jump upon this bloody question, \\n You from the Polack wars, and you from England, \\n Are here arrived give order that these bodies \\n High on a stage be placed to the view; \\n And let me speak to the yet unknowing world \\n How these things came about: so shall you hear \\n Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, \\n Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, \\n Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, \\n And, in this upshot, purposes mistook \\n Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I \\n Truly deliver. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE FORTINBRAS \\n Let us haste to hear it, \\n And call the noblest to the audience. \\n For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune: \\n I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, \\n Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. \\n \\n\\n \\n HORATIO \\n Of that I shall have also cause to speak, \\n And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more; \\n But let this same be presently perform'd, \\n Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance \\n On plots and errors, happen. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE FORTINBRAS \\n Let four captains \\n Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage; \\n For he was likely, had he been put on, \\n To have proved most royally: and, for his passage, \\n The soldiers' music and the rites of war \\n Speak loudly for him. \\n Take up the bodies: such a sight as this \\n Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. \\n Go, bid the soldiers shoot. \\n \\n\\n\\n A dead march.

Rome. A street. \\n Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners \\n\\n \\n FLAVIUS \\n Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home: \\n Is this a holiday? what! know you not, \\n Being mechanical, you ought not walk \\n Upon a labouring day without the sign \\n Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Commoner \\n Why, sir, a carpenter. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARULLUS \\n Where is thy leather apron and thy rule? \\n What dost thou with thy best apparel on? \\n You, sir, what trade are you? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Commoner \\n Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, \\n as you would say, a cobbler. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARULLUS \\n But what trade art thou? answer me directly. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Commoner \\n A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe \\n conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARULLUS \\n What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Commoner \\n Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet, \\n if you be out, sir, I can mend you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARULLUS \\n What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Commoner \\n Why, sir, cobble you. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLAVIUS \\n Thou art a cobbler, art thou? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Commoner \\n Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I \\n meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's \\n matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon \\n to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I \\n recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon \\n neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLAVIUS \\n But wherefore art not in thy shop today? \\n Why dost thou lead these men about the streets? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Commoner \\n Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself \\n into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday, \\n to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARULLUS \\n Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home? \\n What tributaries follow him to Rome, \\n To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels? \\n You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things! \\n O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, \\n Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft \\n Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements, \\n To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops, \\n Your infants in your arms, and there have sat \\n The livelong day, with patient expectation, \\n To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome: \\n And when you saw his chariot but appear, \\n Have you not made an universal shout, \\n That Tiber trembled underneath her banks, \\n To hear the replication of your sounds \\n Made in her concave shores? \\n And do you now put on your best attire? \\n And do you now cull out a holiday? \\n And do you now strew flowers in his way \\n That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone! \\n Run to your houses, fall upon your knees, \\n Pray to the gods to intermit the plague \\n That needs must light on this ingratitude. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLAVIUS \\n Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault, \\n Assemble all the poor men of your sort; \\n Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears \\n Into the channel, till the lowest stream \\n Do kiss the most exalted shores of all. \\n Exeunt all the Commoners \\n See whether their basest metal be not moved; \\n They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness. \\n Go you down that way towards the Capitol; \\n This way will I disrobe the images, \\n If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies. \\n \\n\\n \\n MARULLUS \\n May we do so? \\n You know it is the feast of Lupercal. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLAVIUS \\n It is no matter; let no images \\n Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about, \\n And drive away the vulgar from the streets: \\n So do you too, where you perceive them thick. \\n These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing \\n Will make him fly an ordinary pitch, \\n Who else would soar above the view of men \\n And keep us all in servile fearfulness. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A public place. \\n Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;\\nCALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,\\nCASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among\\nthem a Soothsayer \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Calpurnia! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Calpurnia! \\n \\n\\n \\n CALPURNIA \\n Here, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Stand you directly in Antonius' way, \\n When he doth run his course. Antonius! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Caesar, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Forget not, in your speed, Antonius, \\n To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say, \\n The barren, touched in this holy chase, \\n Shake off their sterile curse. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n I shall remember: \\n When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Set on; and leave no ceremony out. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Ha! who calls? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Bid every noise be still: peace yet again! \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Who is it in the press that calls on me? \\n I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, \\n Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Beware the ides of March. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n What man is that? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Set him before me; let me see his face. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n What say'st thou to me now? speak once again. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Beware the ides of March. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass. \\n \\n\\n\\n Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Will you go see the order of the course? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Not I. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I pray you, do. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I am not gamesome: I do lack some part \\n Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. \\n Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires; \\n I'll leave you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Brutus, I do observe you now of late: \\n I have not from your eyes that gentleness \\n And show of love as I was wont to have: \\n You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand \\n Over your friend that loves you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Cassius, \\n Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look, \\n I turn the trouble of my countenance \\n Merely upon myself. Vexed I am \\n Of late with passions of some difference, \\n Conceptions only proper to myself, \\n Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors; \\n But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-- \\n Among which number, Cassius, be you one-- \\n Nor construe any further my neglect, \\n Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, \\n Forgets the shows of love to other men. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion; \\n By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried \\n Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. \\n Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself, \\n But by reflection, by some other things. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n 'Tis just: \\n And it is very much lamented, Brutus, \\n That you have no such mirrors as will turn \\n Your hidden worthiness into your eye, \\n That you might see your shadow. I have heard, \\n Where many of the best respect in Rome, \\n Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus \\n And groaning underneath this age's yoke, \\n Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, \\n That you would have me seek into myself \\n For that which is not in me? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear: \\n And since you know you cannot see yourself \\n So well as by reflection, I, your glass, \\n Will modestly discover to yourself \\n That of yourself which you yet know not of. \\n And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus: \\n Were I a common laugher, or did use \\n To stale with ordinary oaths my love \\n To every new protester; if you know \\n That I do fawn on men and hug them hard \\n And after scandal them, or if you know \\n That I profess myself in banqueting \\n To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish, and shout \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What means this shouting? I do fear, the people \\n Choose Caesar for their king. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Ay, do you fear it? \\n Then must I think you would not have it so. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well. \\n But wherefore do you hold me here so long? \\n What is it that you would impart to me? \\n If it be aught toward the general good, \\n Set honour in one eye and death i' the other, \\n And I will look on both indifferently, \\n For let the gods so speed me as I love \\n The name of honour more than I fear death. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, \\n As well as I do know your outward favour. \\n Well, honour is the subject of my story. \\n I cannot tell what you and other men \\n Think of this life; but, for my single self, \\n I had as lief not be as live to be \\n In awe of such a thing as I myself. \\n I was born free as Caesar; so were you: \\n We both have fed as well, and we can both \\n Endure the winter's cold as well as he: \\n For once, upon a raw and gusty day, \\n The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, \\n Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now \\n Leap in with me into this angry flood, \\n And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word, \\n Accoutred as I was, I plunged in \\n And bade him follow; so indeed he did. \\n The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it \\n With lusty sinews, throwing it aside \\n And stemming it with hearts of controversy; \\n But ere we could arrive the point proposed, \\n Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!' \\n I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, \\n Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder \\n The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber \\n Did I the tired Caesar. And this man \\n Is now become a god, and Cassius is \\n A wretched creature and must bend his body, \\n If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. \\n He had a fever when he was in Spain, \\n And when the fit was on him, I did mark \\n How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake; \\n His coward lips did from their colour fly, \\n And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world \\n Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan: \\n Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans \\n Mark him and write his speeches in their books, \\n Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,' \\n As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me \\n A man of such a feeble temper should \\n So get the start of the majestic world \\n And bear the palm alone. \\n \\n\\n\\n Shout. Flourish \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Another general shout! \\n I do believe that these applauses are \\n For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world \\n Like a Colossus, and we petty men \\n Walk under his huge legs and peep about \\n To find ourselves dishonourable graves. \\n Men at some time are masters of their fates: \\n The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, \\n But in ourselves, that we are underlings. \\n Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'? \\n Why should that name be sounded more than yours? \\n Write them together, yours is as fair a name; \\n Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; \\n Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em, \\n Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar. \\n Now, in the names of all the gods at once, \\n Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, \\n That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! \\n Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! \\n When went there by an age, since the great flood, \\n But it was famed with more than with one man? \\n When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome, \\n That her wide walls encompass'd but one man? \\n Now is it Rome indeed and room enough, \\n When there is in it but one only man. \\n O, you and I have heard our fathers say, \\n There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd \\n The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome \\n As easily as a king. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n That you do love me, I am nothing jealous; \\n What you would work me to, I have some aim: \\n How I have thought of this and of these times, \\n I shall recount hereafter; for this present, \\n I would not, so with love I might entreat you, \\n Be any further moved. What you have said \\n I will consider; what you have to say \\n I will with patience hear, and find a time \\n Both meet to hear and answer such high things. \\n Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: \\n Brutus had rather be a villager \\n Than to repute himself a son of Rome \\n Under these hard conditions as this time \\n Is like to lay upon us. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I am glad that my weak words \\n Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n The games are done and Caesar is returning. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve; \\n And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you \\n What hath proceeded worthy note to-day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter CAESAR and his Train \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I will do so. But, look you, Cassius, \\n The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow, \\n And all the rest look like a chidden train: \\n Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero \\n Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes \\n As we have seen him in the Capitol, \\n Being cross'd in conference by some senators. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Casca will tell us what the matter is. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Antonius! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Caesar? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Let me have men about me that are fat; \\n Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights: \\n Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look; \\n He thinks too much: such men are dangerous. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous; \\n He is a noble Roman and well given. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Would he were fatter! But I fear him not: \\n Yet if my name were liable to fear, \\n I do not know the man I should avoid \\n So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much; \\n He is a great observer and he looks \\n Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays, \\n As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; \\n Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort \\n As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit \\n That could be moved to smile at any thing. \\n Such men as he be never at heart's ease \\n Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, \\n And therefore are they very dangerous. \\n I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd \\n Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. \\n Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, \\n And tell me truly what thou think'st of him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day, \\n That Caesar looks so sad. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Why, you were with him, were you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Why, there was a crown offered him: and being \\n offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, \\n thus; and then the people fell a-shouting. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What was the second noise for? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Why, for that too. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Why, for that too. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Was the crown offered him thrice? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every \\n time gentler than other, and at every putting-by \\n mine honest neighbours shouted. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Who offered him the crown? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Why, Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it: \\n it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark \\n Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown \\n neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told \\n you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my \\n thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he \\n offered it to him again; then he put it by again: \\n but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his \\n fingers off it. And then he offered it the third \\n time; he put it the third time by: and still as he \\n refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their \\n chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps \\n and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because \\n Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked \\n Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and \\n for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of \\n opening my lips and receiving the bad air. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at \\n mouth, and was speechless. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n 'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I, \\n And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure, \\n Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not \\n clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and \\n displeased them, as they use to do the players in \\n the theatre, I am no true man. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What said he when he came unto himself? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the \\n common herd was glad he refused the crown, he \\n plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his \\n throat to cut. An I had been a man of any \\n occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, \\n I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so \\n he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, \\n If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired \\n their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three \\n or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good \\n soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but \\n there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had \\n stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n And after that, he came, thus sad, away? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Ay. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Did Cicero say any thing? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Ay, he spoke Greek. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n To what effect? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the \\n face again: but those that understood him smiled at \\n one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own \\n part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more \\n news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs \\n off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you \\n well. There was more foolery yet, if I could \\n remember it. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Will you sup with me to-night, Casca? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n No, I am promised forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Will you dine with me to-morrow? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner \\n worth the eating. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Good: I will expect you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Do so. Farewell, both. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! \\n He was quick mettle when he went to school. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n So is he now in execution \\n Of any bold or noble enterprise, \\n However he puts on this tardy form. \\n This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, \\n Which gives men stomach to digest his words \\n With better appetite. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n And so it is. For this time I will leave you: \\n To-morrow, if you please to speak with me, \\n I will come home to you; or, if you will, \\n Come home to me, and I will wait for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I will do so: till then, think of the world. \\n Exit BRUTUS \\n Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see, \\n Thy honourable metal may be wrought \\n From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet \\n That noble minds keep ever with their likes; \\n For who so firm that cannot be seduced? \\n Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus: \\n If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, \\n He should not humour me. I will this night, \\n In several hands, in at his windows throw, \\n As if they came from several citizens, \\n Writings all tending to the great opinion \\n That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely \\n Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at: \\n And after this let Caesar seat him sure; \\n For we will shake him, or worse days endure. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  The same. A street. \\n Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,\\nCASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO \\n\\n \\n CICERO \\n Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home? \\n Why are you breathless? and why stare you so? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth \\n Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, \\n I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds \\n Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen \\n The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam, \\n To be exalted with the threatening clouds: \\n But never till to-night, never till now, \\n Did I go through a tempest dropping fire. \\n Either there is a civil strife in heaven, \\n Or else the world, too saucy with the gods, \\n Incenses them to send destruction. \\n \\n\\n \\n CICERO \\n Why, saw you any thing more wonderful? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n A common slave--you know him well by sight-- \\n Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn \\n Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand, \\n Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd. \\n Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword-- \\n Against the Capitol I met a lion, \\n Who glared upon me, and went surly by, \\n Without annoying me: and there were drawn \\n Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, \\n Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw \\n Men all in fire walk up and down the streets. \\n And yesterday the bird of night did sit \\n Even at noon-day upon the market-place, \\n Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies \\n Do so conjointly meet, let not men say \\n 'These are their reasons; they are natural;' \\n For, I believe, they are portentous things \\n Unto the climate that they point upon. \\n \\n\\n \\n CICERO \\n Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time: \\n But men may construe things after their fashion, \\n Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. \\n Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n He doth; for he did bid Antonius \\n Send word to you he would be there to-morrow. \\n \\n\\n \\n CICERO \\n Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky \\n Is not to walk in. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Farewell, Cicero. \\n \\n\\n Exit CICERO \\n Enter CASSIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Who's there? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n A Roman. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Casca, by your voice. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n A very pleasing night to honest men. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Who ever knew the heavens menace so? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Those that have known the earth so full of faults. \\n For my part, I have walk'd about the streets, \\n Submitting me unto the perilous night, \\n And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see, \\n Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone; \\n And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open \\n The breast of heaven, I did present myself \\n Even in the aim and very flash of it. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? \\n It is the part of men to fear and tremble, \\n When the most mighty gods by tokens send \\n Such dreadful heralds to astonish us. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life \\n That should be in a Roman you do want, \\n Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze \\n And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder, \\n To see the strange impatience of the heavens: \\n But if you would consider the true cause \\n Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, \\n Why birds and beasts from quality and kind, \\n Why old men fool and children calculate, \\n Why all these things change from their ordinance \\n Their natures and preformed faculties \\n To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find \\n That heaven hath infused them with these spirits, \\n To make them instruments of fear and warning \\n Unto some monstrous state. \\n Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man \\n Most like this dreadful night, \\n That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars \\n As doth the lion in the Capitol, \\n A man no mightier than thyself or me \\n In personal action, yet prodigious grown \\n And fearful, as these strange eruptions are. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n 'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Let it be who it is: for Romans now \\n Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors; \\n But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead, \\n And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits; \\n Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow \\n Mean to establish Caesar as a king; \\n And he shall wear his crown by sea and land, \\n In every place, save here in Italy. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I know where I will wear this dagger then; \\n Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius: \\n Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; \\n Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat: \\n Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, \\n Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, \\n Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; \\n But life, being weary of these worldly bars, \\n Never lacks power to dismiss itself. \\n If I know this, know all the world besides, \\n That part of tyranny that I do bear \\n I can shake off at pleasure. \\n \\n\\n\\n Thunder still \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n So can I: \\n So every bondman in his own hand bears \\n The power to cancel his captivity. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n And why should Caesar be a tyrant then? \\n Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf, \\n But that he sees the Romans are but sheep: \\n He were no lion, were not Romans hinds. \\n Those that with haste will make a mighty fire \\n Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome, \\n What rubbish and what offal, when it serves \\n For the base matter to illuminate \\n So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief, \\n Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this \\n Before a willing bondman; then I know \\n My answer must be made. But I am arm'd, \\n And dangers are to me indifferent. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n You speak to Casca, and to such a man \\n That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand: \\n Be factious for redress of all these griefs, \\n And I will set this foot of mine as far \\n As who goes farthest. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n There's a bargain made. \\n Now know you, Casca, I have moved already \\n Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans \\n To undergo with me an enterprise \\n Of honourable-dangerous consequence; \\n And I do know, by this, they stay for me \\n In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night, \\n There is no stir or walking in the streets; \\n And the complexion of the element \\n In favour's like the work we have in hand, \\n Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n 'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait; \\n He is a friend. \\n Enter CINNA \\n Cinna, where haste you so? \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n No, it is Casca; one incorporate \\n To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna? \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this! \\n There's two or three of us have seen strange sights. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Am I not stay'd for? tell me. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n Yes, you are. \\n O Cassius, if you could \\n But win the noble Brutus to our party-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper, \\n And look you lay it in the praetor's chair, \\n Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this \\n In at his window; set this up with wax \\n Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done, \\n Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us. \\n Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there? \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone \\n To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie, \\n And so bestow these papers as you bade me. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n That done, repair to Pompey's theatre. \\n Exit CINNA \\n Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day \\n See Brutus at his house: three parts of him \\n Is ours already, and the man entire \\n Upon the next encounter yields him ours. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n O, he sits high in all the people's hearts: \\n And that which would appear offence in us, \\n His countenance, like richest alchemy, \\n Will change to virtue and to worthiness. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Him and his worth and our great need of him \\n You have right well conceited. Let us go, \\n For it is after midnight; and ere day \\n We will awake him and be sure of him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT II \\n\\n SCENE I.  Rome. BRUTUS's orchard. \\n Enter BRUTUS \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What, Lucius, ho! \\n I cannot, by the progress of the stars, \\n Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say! \\n I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly. \\n When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LUCIUS \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Call'd you, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Get me a taper in my study, Lucius: \\n When it is lighted, come and call me here. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n I will, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n It must be by his death: and for my part, \\n I know no personal cause to spurn at him, \\n But for the general. He would be crown'd: \\n How that might change his nature, there's the question. \\n It is the bright day that brings forth the adder; \\n And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;-- \\n And then, I grant, we put a sting in him, \\n That at his will he may do danger with. \\n The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins \\n Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar, \\n I have not known when his affections sway'd \\n More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof, \\n That lowliness is young ambition's ladder, \\n Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; \\n But when he once attains the upmost round. \\n He then unto the ladder turns his back, \\n Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees \\n By which he did ascend. So Caesar may. \\n Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel \\n Will bear no colour for the thing he is, \\n Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented, \\n Would run to these and these extremities: \\n And therefore think him as a serpent's egg \\n Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous, \\n And kill him in the shell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter LUCIUS \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n The taper burneth in your closet, sir. \\n Searching the window for a flint, I found \\n This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure, \\n It did not lie there when I went to bed. \\n \\n\\n\\n Gives him the letter \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Get you to bed again; it is not day. \\n Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n I know not, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Look in the calendar, and bring me word. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n I will, sir. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n The exhalations whizzing in the air \\n Give so much light that I may read by them. \\n Opens the letter and reads \\n 'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself. \\n Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress! \\n Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!' \\n Such instigations have been often dropp'd \\n Where I have took them up. \\n 'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out: \\n Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome? \\n My ancestors did from the streets of Rome \\n The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king. \\n 'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated \\n To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise: \\n If the redress will follow, thou receivest \\n Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus! \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter LUCIUS \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Sir, March is wasted fourteen days. \\n \\n\\n\\n Knocking within \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n 'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks. \\n Exit LUCIUS \\n Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, \\n I have not slept. \\n Between the acting of a dreadful thing \\n And the first motion, all the interim is \\n Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream: \\n The Genius and the mortal instruments \\n Are then in council; and the state of man, \\n Like to a little kingdom, suffers then \\n The nature of an insurrection. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter LUCIUS \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door, \\n Who doth desire to see you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Is he alone? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n No, sir, there are moe with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Do you know them? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears, \\n And half their faces buried in their cloaks, \\n That by no means I may discover them \\n By any mark of favour. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Let 'em enter. \\n Exit LUCIUS \\n They are the faction. O conspiracy, \\n Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, \\n When evils are most free? O, then by day \\n Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough \\n To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy; \\n Hide it in smiles and affability: \\n For if thou path, thy native semblance on, \\n Not Erebus itself were dim enough \\n To hide thee from prevention. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS\\nBRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I think we are too bold upon your rest: \\n Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I have been up this hour, awake all night. \\n Know I these men that come along with you? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Yes, every man of them, and no man here \\n But honours you; and every one doth wish \\n You had but that opinion of yourself \\n Which every noble Roman bears of you. \\n This is Trebonius. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n He is welcome hither. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n This, Decius Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n He is welcome too. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n They are all welcome. \\n What watchful cares do interpose themselves \\n Betwixt your eyes and night? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Shall I entreat a word? \\n \\n\\n\\n BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Here lies the east: doth not the day break here? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n No. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines \\n That fret the clouds are messengers of day. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n You shall confess that you are both deceived. \\n Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, \\n Which is a great way growing on the south, \\n Weighing the youthful season of the year. \\n Some two months hence up higher toward the north \\n He first presents his fire; and the high east \\n Stands, as the Capitol, directly here. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Give me your hands all over, one by one. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n And let us swear our resolution. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n No, not an oath: if not the face of men, \\n The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,-- \\n If these be motives weak, break off betimes, \\n And every man hence to his idle bed; \\n So let high-sighted tyranny range on, \\n Till each man drop by lottery. But if these, \\n As I am sure they do, bear fire enough \\n To kindle cowards and to steel with valour \\n The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, \\n What need we any spur but our own cause, \\n To prick us to redress? what other bond \\n Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word, \\n And will not palter? and what other oath \\n Than honesty to honesty engaged, \\n That this shall be, or we will fall for it? \\n Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, \\n Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls \\n That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear \\n Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain \\n The even virtue of our enterprise, \\n Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits, \\n To think that or our cause or our performance \\n Did need an oath; when every drop of blood \\n That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, \\n Is guilty of a several bastardy, \\n If he do break the smallest particle \\n Of any promise that hath pass'd from him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n But what of Cicero? shall we sound him? \\n I think he will stand very strong with us. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Let us not leave him out. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n No, by no means. \\n \\n\\n \\n METELLUS CIMBER \\n O, let us have him, for his silver hairs \\n Will purchase us a good opinion \\n And buy men's voices to commend our deeds: \\n It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands; \\n Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, \\n But all be buried in his gravity. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O, name him not: let us not break with him; \\n For he will never follow any thing \\n That other men begin. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Then leave him out. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Indeed he is not fit. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet, \\n Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, \\n Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him \\n A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means, \\n If he improve them, may well stretch so far \\n As to annoy us all: which to prevent, \\n Let Antony and Caesar fall together. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, \\n To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, \\n Like wrath in death and envy afterwards; \\n For Antony is but a limb of Caesar: \\n Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. \\n We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar; \\n And in the spirit of men there is no blood: \\n O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit, \\n And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, \\n Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends, \\n Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully; \\n Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, \\n Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds: \\n And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, \\n Stir up their servants to an act of rage, \\n And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make \\n Our purpose necessary and not envious: \\n Which so appearing to the common eyes, \\n We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers. \\n And for Mark Antony, think not of him; \\n For he can do no more than Caesar's arm \\n When Caesar's head is off. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Yet I fear him; \\n For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar-- \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him: \\n If he love Caesar, all that he can do \\n Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar: \\n And that were much he should; for he is given \\n To sports, to wildness and much company. \\n \\n\\n \\n TREBONIUS \\n There is no fear in him; let him not die; \\n For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter. \\n \\n\\n\\n Clock strikes \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Peace! count the clock. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n The clock hath stricken three. \\n \\n\\n \\n TREBONIUS \\n 'Tis time to part. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n But it is doubtful yet, \\n Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no; \\n For he is superstitious grown of late, \\n Quite from the main opinion he held once \\n Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies: \\n It may be, these apparent prodigies, \\n The unaccustom'd terror of this night, \\n And the persuasion of his augurers, \\n May hold him from the Capitol to-day. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Never fear that: if he be so resolved, \\n I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear \\n That unicorns may be betray'd with trees, \\n And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, \\n Lions with toils and men with flatterers; \\n But when I tell him he hates flatterers, \\n He says he does, being then most flattered. \\n Let me work; \\n For I can give his humour the true bent, \\n And I will bring him to the Capitol. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost? \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n Be that the uttermost, and fail not then. \\n \\n\\n \\n METELLUS CIMBER \\n Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, \\n Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey: \\n I wonder none of you have thought of him. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Now, good Metellus, go along by him: \\n He loves me well, and I have given him reasons; \\n Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus. \\n And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember \\n What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily; \\n Let not our looks put on our purposes, \\n But bear it as our Roman actors do, \\n With untired spirits and formal constancy: \\n And so good morrow to you every one. \\n Exeunt all but BRUTUS \\n Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter; \\n Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber: \\n Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies, \\n Which busy care draws in the brains of men; \\n Therefore thou sleep'st so sound. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter PORTIA \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Brutus, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now? \\n It is not for your health thus to commit \\n Your weak condition to the raw cold morning. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus, \\n Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper, \\n You suddenly arose, and walk'd about, \\n Musing and sighing, with your arms across, \\n And when I ask'd you what the matter was, \\n You stared upon me with ungentle looks; \\n I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head, \\n And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot; \\n Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not, \\n But, with an angry wafture of your hand, \\n Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did; \\n Fearing to strengthen that impatience \\n Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal \\n Hoping it was but an effect of humour, \\n Which sometime hath his hour with every man. \\n It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep, \\n And could it work so much upon your shape \\n As it hath much prevail'd on your condition, \\n I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord, \\n Make me acquainted with your cause of grief. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I am not well in health, and that is all. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health, \\n He would embrace the means to come by it. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Is Brutus sick? and is it physical \\n To walk unbraced and suck up the humours \\n Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, \\n And will he steal out of his wholesome bed, \\n To dare the vile contagion of the night \\n And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air \\n To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus; \\n You have some sick offence within your mind, \\n Which, by the right and virtue of my place, \\n I ought to know of: and, upon my knees, \\n I charm you, by my once-commended beauty, \\n By all your vows of love and that great vow \\n Which did incorporate and make us one, \\n That you unfold to me, yourself, your half, \\n Why you are heavy, and what men to-night \\n Have had to resort to you: for here have been \\n Some six or seven, who did hide their faces \\n Even from darkness. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Kneel not, gentle Portia. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus. \\n Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, \\n Is it excepted I should know no secrets \\n That appertain to you? Am I yourself \\n But, as it were, in sort or limitation, \\n To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, \\n And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs \\n Of your good pleasure? If it be no more, \\n Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n You are my true and honourable wife, \\n As dear to me as are the ruddy drops \\n That visit my sad heart \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n If this were true, then should I know this secret. \\n I grant I am a woman; but withal \\n A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife: \\n I grant I am a woman; but withal \\n A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter. \\n Think you I am no stronger than my sex, \\n Being so father'd and so husbanded? \\n Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em: \\n I have made strong proof of my constancy, \\n Giving myself a voluntary wound \\n Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience. \\n And not my husband's secrets? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O ye gods, \\n Render me worthy of this noble wife! \\n Knocking within \\n Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile; \\n And by and by thy bosom shall partake \\n The secrets of my heart. \\n All my engagements I will construe to thee, \\n All the charactery of my sad brows: \\n Leave me with haste. \\n Exit PORTIA \\n Lucius, who's that knocks? \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n He is a sick man that would speak with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of. \\n Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how? \\n \\n\\n \\n LIGARIUS \\n Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, \\n To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick! \\n \\n\\n \\n LIGARIUS \\n I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand \\n Any exploit worthy the name of honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, \\n Had you a healthful ear to hear of it. \\n \\n\\n \\n LIGARIUS \\n By all the gods that Romans bow before, \\n I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome! \\n Brave son, derived from honourable loins! \\n Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up \\n My mortified spirit. Now bid me run, \\n And I will strive with things impossible; \\n Yea, get the better of them. What's to do? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n A piece of work that will make sick men whole. \\n \\n\\n \\n LIGARIUS \\n But are not some whole that we must make sick? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n That must we also. What it is, my Caius, \\n I shall unfold to thee, as we are going \\n To whom it must be done. \\n \\n\\n \\n LIGARIUS \\n Set on your foot, \\n And with a heart new-fired I follow you, \\n To do I know not what: but it sufficeth \\n That Brutus leads me on. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Follow me, then. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  CAESAR's house. \\n Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his\\nnight-gown \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night: \\n Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out, \\n 'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Servant \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Go bid the priests do present sacrifice \\n And bring me their opinions of success. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n I will, my lord. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Enter CALPURNIA \\n\\n \\n CALPURNIA \\n What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth? \\n You shall not stir out of your house to-day. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me \\n Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see \\n The face of Caesar, they are vanished. \\n \\n\\n \\n CALPURNIA \\n Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, \\n Yet now they fright me. There is one within, \\n Besides the things that we have heard and seen, \\n Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. \\n A lioness hath whelped in the streets; \\n And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead; \\n Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds, \\n In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, \\n Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol; \\n The noise of battle hurtled in the air, \\n Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, \\n And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. \\n O Caesar! these things are beyond all use, \\n And I do fear them. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n What can be avoided \\n Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? \\n Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions \\n Are to the world in general as to Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CALPURNIA \\n When beggars die, there are no comets seen; \\n The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Cowards die many times before their deaths; \\n The valiant never taste of death but once. \\n Of all the wonders that I yet have heard. \\n It seems to me most strange that men should fear; \\n Seeing that death, a necessary end, \\n Will come when it will come. \\n Re-enter Servant \\n What say the augurers? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n They would not have you to stir forth to-day. \\n Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, \\n They could not find a heart within the beast. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n The gods do this in shame of cowardice: \\n Caesar should be a beast without a heart, \\n If he should stay at home to-day for fear. \\n No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well \\n That Caesar is more dangerous than he: \\n We are two lions litter'd in one day, \\n And I the elder and more terrible: \\n And Caesar shall go forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n CALPURNIA \\n Alas, my lord, \\n Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. \\n Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear \\n That keeps you in the house, and not your own. \\n We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house: \\n And he shall say you are not well to-day: \\n Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Mark Antony shall say I am not well, \\n And, for thy humour, I will stay at home. \\n Enter DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar: \\n I come to fetch you to the senate-house. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n And you are come in very happy time, \\n To bear my greeting to the senators \\n And tell them that I will not come to-day: \\n Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser: \\n I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CALPURNIA \\n Say he is sick. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Shall Caesar send a lie? \\n Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far, \\n To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth? \\n Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, \\n Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n The cause is in my will: I will not come; \\n That is enough to satisfy the senate. \\n But for your private satisfaction, \\n Because I love you, I will let you know: \\n Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home: \\n She dreamt to-night she saw my statua, \\n Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, \\n Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans \\n Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it: \\n And these does she apply for warnings, and portents, \\n And evils imminent; and on her knee \\n Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n This dream is all amiss interpreted; \\n It was a vision fair and fortunate: \\n Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, \\n In which so many smiling Romans bathed, \\n Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck \\n Reviving blood, and that great men shall press \\n For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance. \\n This by Calpurnia's dream is signified. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n And this way have you well expounded it. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n I have, when you have heard what I can say: \\n And know it now: the senate have concluded \\n To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. \\n If you shall send them word you will not come, \\n Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock \\n Apt to be render'd, for some one to say \\n 'Break up the senate till another time, \\n When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.' \\n If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper \\n 'Lo, Caesar is afraid'? \\n Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love \\n To our proceeding bids me tell you this; \\n And reason to my love is liable. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia! \\n I am ashamed I did yield to them. \\n Give me my robe, for I will go. \\n Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA,\\nTREBONIUS, and CINNA \\n And look where Publius is come to fetch me. \\n \\n\\n \\n PUBLIUS \\n Good morrow, Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Welcome, Publius. \\n What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too? \\n Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius, \\n Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy \\n As that same ague which hath made you lean. \\n What is 't o'clock? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Caesar, 'tis strucken eight. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n I thank you for your pains and courtesy. \\n Enter ANTONY \\n See! Antony, that revels long o' nights, \\n Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n So to most noble Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Bid them prepare within: \\n I am to blame to be thus waited for. \\n Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius! \\n I have an hour's talk in store for you; \\n Remember that you call on me to-day: \\n Be near me, that I may remember you. \\n \\n\\n \\n TREBONIUS \\n Caesar, I will: \\n Aside \\n and so near will I be, \\n That your best friends shall wish I had been further. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me; \\n And we, like friends, will straightway go together. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Aside   That every like is not the same, O Caesar, \\n The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A street near the Capitol. \\n Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper \\n\\n \\n ARTEMIDORUS \\n 'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; \\n come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not \\n Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus \\n loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. \\n There is but one mind in all these men, and it is \\n bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, \\n look about you: security gives way to conspiracy. \\n The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover, \\n 'ARTEMIDORUS.' \\n Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, \\n And as a suitor will I give him this. \\n My heart laments that virtue cannot live \\n Out of the teeth of emulation. \\n If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live; \\n If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS. \\n Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house; \\n Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone: \\n Why dost thou stay? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n To know my errand, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I would have had thee there, and here again, \\n Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there. \\n O constancy, be strong upon my side, \\n Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue! \\n I have a man's mind, but a woman's might. \\n How hard it is for women to keep counsel! \\n Art thou here yet? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Madam, what should I do? \\n Run to the Capitol, and nothing else? \\n And so return to you, and nothing else? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well, \\n For he went sickly forth: and take good note \\n What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him. \\n Hark, boy! what noise is that? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n I hear none, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Prithee, listen well; \\n I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray, \\n And the wind brings it from the Capitol. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Sooth, madam, I hear nothing. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter the Soothsayer \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n At mine own house, good lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n What is't o'clock? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n About the ninth hour, lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand, \\n To see him pass on to the Capitol. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar \\n To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, \\n I shall beseech him to befriend himself. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him? \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance. \\n Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow: \\n The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, \\n Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, \\n Will crowd a feeble man almost to death: \\n I'll get me to a place more void, and there \\n Speak to great Caesar as he comes along. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing \\n The heart of woman is! O Brutus, \\n The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise! \\n Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit \\n That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint. \\n Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord; \\n Say I am merry: come to me again, \\n And bring me word what he doth say to thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt severally \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.  Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above. \\n A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the\\nSoothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,\\nCASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,\\nTREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS,\\nPUBLIUS, and others \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n To the Soothsayer   The ides of March are come. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soothsayer \\n Ay, Caesar; but not gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n ARTEMIDORUS \\n Hail, Caesar! read this schedule. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread, \\n At your best leisure, this his humble suit. \\n \\n\\n \\n ARTEMIDORUS \\n O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit \\n That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n What touches us ourself shall be last served. \\n \\n\\n \\n ARTEMIDORUS \\n Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n What, is the fellow mad? \\n \\n\\n \\n PUBLIUS \\n Sirrah, give place. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n What, urge you your petitions in the street? \\n Come to the Capitol. \\n \\n\\n\\n CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest\\nfollowing \\n\\n \\n POPILIUS \\n I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n What enterprise, Popilius? \\n \\n\\n \\n POPILIUS \\n Fare you well. \\n \\n\\n\\n Advances to CAESAR \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What said Popilius Lena? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive. \\n I fear our purpose is discovered. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention. \\n Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, \\n Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, \\n For I will slay myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Cassius, be constant: \\n Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes; \\n For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus. \\n He draws Mark Antony out of the way. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go, \\n And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n He is address'd: press near and second him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Are we all ready? What is now amiss \\n That Caesar and his senate must redress? \\n \\n\\n \\n METELLUS CIMBER \\n Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, \\n Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat \\n An humble heart,-- \\n \\n\\n\\n Kneeling \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n I must prevent thee, Cimber. \\n These couchings and these lowly courtesies \\n Might fire the blood of ordinary men, \\n And turn pre-ordinance and first decree \\n Into the law of children. Be not fond, \\n To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood \\n That will be thaw'd from the true quality \\n With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words, \\n Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning. \\n Thy brother by decree is banished: \\n If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, \\n I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. \\n Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause \\n Will he be satisfied. \\n \\n\\n \\n METELLUS CIMBER \\n Is there no voice more worthy than my own \\n To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear \\n For the repealing of my banish'd brother? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar; \\n Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may \\n Have an immediate freedom of repeal. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n What, Brutus! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon: \\n As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall, \\n To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I could be well moved, if I were as you: \\n If I could pray to move, prayers would move me: \\n But I am constant as the northern star, \\n Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality \\n There is no fellow in the firmament. \\n The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks, \\n They are all fire and every one doth shine, \\n But there's but one in all doth hold his place: \\n So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men, \\n And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive; \\n Yet in the number I do know but one \\n That unassailable holds on his rank, \\n Unshaked of motion: and that I am he, \\n Let me a little show it, even in this; \\n That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd, \\n And constant do remain to keep him so. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n O Caesar,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus? \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n Great Caesar,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Speak, hands for me! \\n \\n\\n\\n CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and\\nBRUTUS stab CAESAR \\n\\n \\n CAESAR \\n Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! \\n Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Some to the common pulpits, and cry out \\n 'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!' \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n People and senators, be not affrighted; \\n Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASCA \\n Go to the pulpit, Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n And Cassius too. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Where's Publius? \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA \\n Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. \\n \\n\\n \\n METELLUS CIMBER \\n Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's \\n Should chance-- \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer; \\n There is no harm intended to your person, \\n Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n And leave us, Publius; lest that the people, \\n Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Do so: and let no man abide this deed, \\n But we the doers. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter TREBONIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Where is Antony? \\n \\n\\n \\n TREBONIUS \\n Fled to his house amazed: \\n Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run \\n As it were doomsday. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Fates, we will know your pleasures: \\n That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time \\n And drawing days out, that men stand upon. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life \\n Cuts off so many years of fearing death. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Grant that, and then is death a benefit: \\n So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged \\n His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, \\n And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood \\n Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords: \\n Then walk we forth, even to the market-place, \\n And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads, \\n Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!' \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence \\n Shall this our lofty scene be acted over \\n In states unborn and accents yet unknown! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, \\n That now on Pompey's basis lies along \\n No worthier than the dust! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n So oft as that shall be, \\n So often shall the knot of us be call'd \\n The men that gave their country liberty. \\n \\n\\n \\n DECIUS BRUTUS \\n What, shall we forth? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Ay, every man away: \\n Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels \\n With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Servant \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel: \\n Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down; \\n And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: \\n Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; \\n Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving: \\n Say I love Brutus, and I honour him; \\n Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him. \\n If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony \\n May safely come to him, and be resolved \\n How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, \\n Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead \\n So well as Brutus living; but will follow \\n The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus \\n Thorough the hazards of this untrod state \\n With all true faith. So says my master Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman; \\n I never thought him worse. \\n Tell him, so please him come unto this place, \\n He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour, \\n Depart untouch'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n I'll fetch him presently. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I know that we shall have him well to friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I wish we may: but yet have I a mind \\n That fears him much; and my misgiving still \\n Falls shrewdly to the purpose. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n But here comes Antony. \\n Re-enter ANTONY \\n Welcome, Mark Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low? \\n Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, \\n Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well. \\n I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, \\n Who else must be let blood, who else is rank: \\n If I myself, there is no hour so fit \\n As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument \\n Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich \\n With the most noble blood of all this world. \\n I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, \\n Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, \\n Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years, \\n I shall not find myself so apt to die: \\n No place will please me so, no mean of death, \\n As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, \\n The choice and master spirits of this age. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O Antony, beg not your death of us. \\n Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, \\n As, by our hands and this our present act, \\n You see we do, yet see you but our hands \\n And this the bleeding business they have done: \\n Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; \\n And pity to the general wrong of Rome-- \\n As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-- \\n Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, \\n To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony: \\n Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts \\n Of brothers' temper, do receive you in \\n With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Your voice shall be as strong as any man's \\n In the disposing of new dignities. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Only be patient till we have appeased \\n The multitude, beside themselves with fear, \\n And then we will deliver you the cause, \\n Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, \\n Have thus proceeded. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n I doubt not of your wisdom. \\n Let each man render me his bloody hand: \\n First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you; \\n Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand; \\n Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus; \\n Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours; \\n Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius. \\n Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say? \\n My credit now stands on such slippery ground, \\n That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, \\n Either a coward or a flatterer. \\n That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true: \\n If then thy spirit look upon us now, \\n Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death, \\n To see thy thy Anthony making his peace, \\n Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, \\n Most noble! in the presence of thy corse? \\n Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, \\n Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, \\n It would become me better than to close \\n In terms of friendship with thine enemies. \\n Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart; \\n Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand, \\n Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe. \\n O world, thou wast the forest to this hart; \\n And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee. \\n How like a deer, strucken by many princes, \\n Dost thou here lie! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Mark Antony,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Pardon me, Caius Cassius: \\n The enemies of Caesar shall say this; \\n Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I blame you not for praising Caesar so; \\n But what compact mean you to have with us? \\n Will you be prick'd in number of our friends; \\n Or shall we on, and not depend on you? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed, \\n Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar. \\n Friends am I with you all and love you all, \\n Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons \\n Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Or else were this a savage spectacle: \\n Our reasons are so full of good regard \\n That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, \\n You should be satisfied. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n That's all I seek: \\n And am moreover suitor that I may \\n Produce his body to the market-place; \\n And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, \\n Speak in the order of his funeral. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n You shall, Mark Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Brutus, a word with you. \\n Aside to BRUTUS \\n You know not what you do: do not consent \\n That Antony speak in his funeral: \\n Know you how much the people may be moved \\n By that which he will utter? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n By your pardon; \\n I will myself into the pulpit first, \\n And show the reason of our Caesar's death: \\n What Antony shall speak, I will protest \\n He speaks by leave and by permission, \\n And that we are contented Caesar shall \\n Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. \\n It shall advantage more than do us wrong. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I know not what may fall; I like it not. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body. \\n You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, \\n But speak all good you can devise of Caesar, \\n And say you do't by our permission; \\n Else shall you not have any hand at all \\n About his funeral: and you shall speak \\n In the same pulpit whereto I am going, \\n After my speech is ended. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Be it so. \\n I do desire no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Prepare the body then, and follow us. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but ANTONY \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, \\n That I am meek and gentle with these butchers! \\n Thou art the ruins of the noblest man \\n That ever lived in the tide of times. \\n Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! \\n Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,-- \\n Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips, \\n To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue-- \\n A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; \\n Domestic fury and fierce civil strife \\n Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; \\n Blood and destruction shall be so in use \\n And dreadful objects so familiar \\n That mothers shall but smile when they behold \\n Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war; \\n All pity choked with custom of fell deeds: \\n And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge, \\n With Ate by his side come hot from hell, \\n Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice \\n Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war; \\n That this foul deed shall smell above the earth \\n With carrion men, groaning for burial. \\n Enter a Servant \\n You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n I do, Mark Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n He did receive his letters, and is coming; \\n And bid me say to you by word of mouth-- \\n O Caesar!-- \\n \\n\\n\\n Seeing the body \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep. \\n Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes, \\n Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, \\n Began to water. Is thy master coming? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced: \\n Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, \\n No Rome of safety for Octavius yet; \\n Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile; \\n Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse \\n Into the market-place: there shall I try \\n In my oration, how the people take \\n The cruel issue of these bloody men; \\n According to the which, thou shalt discourse \\n To young Octavius of the state of things. \\n Lend me your hand. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt with CAESAR's body \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  The Forum. \\n Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens \\n\\n \\n Citizens \\n We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Then follow me, and give me audience, friends. \\n Cassius, go you into the other street, \\n And part the numbers. \\n Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here; \\n Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; \\n And public reasons shall be rendered \\n Of Caesar's death. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n I will hear Brutus speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons, \\n When severally we hear them rendered. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS\\ngoes into the pulpit \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n The noble Brutus is ascended: silence! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Be patient till the last. \\n Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my \\n cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me \\n for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that \\n you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and \\n awake your senses, that you may the better judge. \\n If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of \\n Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar \\n was no less than his. If then that friend demand \\n why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: \\n --Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved \\n Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and \\n die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live \\n all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; \\n as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was \\n valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I \\n slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his \\n fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his \\n ambition. Who is here so base that would be a \\n bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. \\n Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If \\n any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so \\n vile that will not love his country? If any, speak; \\n for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n None, Brutus, none. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Then none have I offended. I have done no more to \\n Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of \\n his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not \\n extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences \\n enforced, for which he suffered death. \\n Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body \\n Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who, \\n though he had no hand in his death, shall receive \\n the benefit of his dying, a place in the \\n commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this \\n I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the \\n good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, \\n when it shall please my country to need my death. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Live, Brutus! live, live! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Bring him with triumph home unto his house. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Give him a statue with his ancestors. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Let him be Caesar. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Caesar's better parts \\n Shall be crown'd in Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n We'll bring him to his house \\n With shouts and clamours. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n My countrymen,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Peace, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Good countrymen, let me depart alone, \\n And, for my sake, stay here with Antony: \\n Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech \\n Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony, \\n By our permission, is allow'd to make. \\n I do entreat you, not a man depart, \\n Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Let him go up into the public chair; \\n We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Goes into the pulpit \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n What does he say of Brutus? \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n He says, for Brutus' sake, \\n He finds himself beholding to us all. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n This Caesar was a tyrant. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Nay, that's certain: \\n We are blest that Rome is rid of him. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Peace! let us hear what Antony can say. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n You gentle Romans,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Citizens \\n Peace, ho! let us hear him. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; \\n I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. \\n The evil that men do lives after them; \\n The good is oft interred with their bones; \\n So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus \\n Hath told you Caesar was ambitious: \\n If it were so, it was a grievous fault, \\n And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it. \\n Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-- \\n For Brutus is an honourable man; \\n So are they all, all honourable men-- \\n Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. \\n He was my friend, faithful and just to me: \\n But Brutus says he was ambitious; \\n And Brutus is an honourable man. \\n He hath brought many captives home to Rome \\n Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: \\n Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? \\n When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: \\n Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: \\n Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; \\n And Brutus is an honourable man. \\n You all did see that on the Lupercal \\n I thrice presented him a kingly crown, \\n Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition? \\n Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; \\n And, sure, he is an honourable man. \\n I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, \\n But here I am to speak what I do know. \\n You all did love him once, not without cause: \\n What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? \\n O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, \\n And men have lost their reason. Bear with me; \\n My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, \\n And I must pause till it come back to me. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n If thou consider rightly of the matter, \\n Caesar has had great wrong. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Has he, masters? \\n I fear there will a worse come in his place. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown; \\n Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n If it be found so, some will dear abide it. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Now mark him, he begins again to speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n But yesterday the word of Caesar might \\n Have stood against the world; now lies he there. \\n And none so poor to do him reverence. \\n O masters, if I were disposed to stir \\n Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, \\n I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong, \\n Who, you all know, are honourable men: \\n I will not do them wrong; I rather choose \\n To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, \\n Than I will wrong such honourable men. \\n But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar; \\n I found it in his closet, 'tis his will: \\n Let but the commons hear this testament-- \\n Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-- \\n And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds \\n And dip their napkins in his sacred blood, \\n Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, \\n And, dying, mention it within their wills, \\n Bequeathing it as a rich legacy \\n Unto their issue. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it; \\n It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. \\n You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; \\n And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar, \\n It will inflame you, it will make you mad: \\n 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs; \\n For, if you should, O, what would come of it! \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony; \\n You shall read us the will, Caesar's will. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Will you be patient? will you stay awhile? \\n I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it: \\n I fear I wrong the honourable men \\n Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n They were traitors: honourable men! \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n The will! the testament! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n You will compel me, then, to read the will? \\n Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, \\n And let me show you him that made the will. \\n Shall I descend? and will you give me leave? \\n \\n\\n \\n Several Citizens \\n Come down. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Descend. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n You shall have leave. \\n \\n\\n\\n ANTONY comes down \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n A ring; stand round. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Stand from the hearse, stand from the body. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Room for Antony, most noble Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off. \\n \\n\\n \\n Several Citizens \\n Stand back; room; bear back. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. \\n You all do know this mantle: I remember \\n The first time ever Caesar put it on; \\n 'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent, \\n That day he overcame the Nervii: \\n Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through: \\n See what a rent the envious Casca made: \\n Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd; \\n And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away, \\n Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it, \\n As rushing out of doors, to be resolved \\n If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no; \\n For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel: \\n Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! \\n This was the most unkindest cut of all; \\n For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, \\n Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, \\n Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart; \\n And, in his mantle muffling up his face, \\n Even at the base of Pompey's statua, \\n Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. \\n O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! \\n Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, \\n Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us. \\n O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel \\n The dint of pity: these are gracious drops. \\n Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold \\n Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here, \\n Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n O piteous spectacle! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n O noble Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n O woful day! \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n O traitors, villains! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n O most bloody sight! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n We will be revenged. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! \\n Let not a traitor live! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Stay, countrymen. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Peace there! hear the noble Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up \\n To such a sudden flood of mutiny. \\n They that have done this deed are honourable: \\n What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, \\n That made them do it: they are wise and honourable, \\n And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you. \\n I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts: \\n I am no orator, as Brutus is; \\n But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man, \\n That love my friend; and that they know full well \\n That gave me public leave to speak of him: \\n For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, \\n Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech, \\n To stir men's blood: I only speak right on; \\n I tell you that which you yourselves do know; \\n Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, \\n And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus, \\n And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony \\n Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue \\n In every wound of Caesar that should move \\n The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n We'll mutiny. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n We'll burn the house of Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Away, then! come, seek the conspirators. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Why, friends, you go to do you know not what: \\n Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? \\n Alas, you know not: I must tell you then: \\n You have forgot the will I told you of. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal. \\n To every Roman citizen he gives, \\n To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n O royal Caesar! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Hear me with patience. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Peace, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, \\n His private arbours and new-planted orchards, \\n On this side Tiber; he hath left them you, \\n And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures, \\n To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves. \\n Here was a Caesar! when comes such another? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Never, never. Come, away, away! \\n We'll burn his body in the holy place, \\n And with the brands fire the traitors' houses. \\n Take up the body. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Go fetch fire. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Pluck down benches. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Pluck down forms, windows, any thing. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Citizens with the body \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot, \\n Take thou what course thou wilt! \\n Enter a Servant \\n How now, fellow! \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Where is he? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n And thither will I straight to visit him: \\n He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry, \\n And in this mood will give us any thing. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius \\n Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Belike they had some notice of the people, \\n How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A street. \\n Enter CINNA the poet \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar, \\n And things unlucky charge my fantasy: \\n I have no will to wander forth of doors, \\n Yet something leads me forth. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Citizens \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n What is your name? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Whither are you going? \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Where do you dwell? \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Are you a married man or a bachelor? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n Answer every man directly. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Ay, and briefly. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Ay, and wisely. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Ay, and truly, you were best. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I \\n dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to \\n answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and \\n truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry: \\n you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n As a friend or an enemy? \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n As a friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Citizen \\n That matter is answered directly. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n For your dwelling,--briefly. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Your name, sir, truly. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n Truly, my name is Cinna. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses. \\n \\n\\n \\n CINNA THE POET \\n I am not Cinna the conspirator. \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Citizen \\n It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his \\n name out of his heart, and turn him going. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Citizen \\n Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands: \\n to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius' \\n house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT IV \\n\\n SCENE I.  A house in Rome. \\n ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus? \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n I do consent-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Prick him down, Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n Upon condition Publius shall not live, \\n Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him. \\n But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house; \\n Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine \\n How to cut off some charge in legacies. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEPIDUS \\n What, shall I find you here? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Or here, or at the Capitol. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit LEPIDUS \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n This is a slight unmeritable man, \\n Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit, \\n The three-fold world divided, he should stand \\n One of the three to share it? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n So you thought him; \\n And took his voice who should be prick'd to die, \\n In our black sentence and proscription. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Octavius, I have seen more days than you: \\n And though we lay these honours on this man, \\n To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads, \\n He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, \\n To groan and sweat under the business, \\n Either led or driven, as we point the way; \\n And having brought our treasure where we will, \\n Then take we down his load, and turn him off, \\n Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears, \\n And graze in commons. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n You may do your will; \\n But he's a tried and valiant soldier. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n So is my horse, Octavius; and for that \\n I do appoint him store of provender: \\n It is a creature that I teach to fight, \\n To wind, to stop, to run directly on, \\n His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit. \\n And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so; \\n He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth; \\n A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds \\n On abjects, orts and imitations, \\n Which, out of use and staled by other men, \\n Begin his fashion: do not talk of him, \\n But as a property. And now, Octavius, \\n Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius \\n Are levying powers: we must straight make head: \\n Therefore let our alliance be combined, \\n Our best friends made, our means stretch'd \\n And let us presently go sit in council, \\n How covert matters may be best disclosed, \\n And open perils surest answered. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Let us do so: for we are at the stake, \\n And bay'd about with many enemies; \\n And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, \\n Millions of mischiefs. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent. \\n Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and\\nSoldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Stand, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n Give the word, ho! and stand. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n He is at hand; and Pindarus is come \\n To do you salutation from his master. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus, \\n In his own change, or by ill officers, \\n Hath given me some worthy cause to wish \\n Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand, \\n I shall be satisfied. \\n \\n\\n \\n PINDARUS \\n I do not doubt \\n But that my noble master will appear \\n Such as he is, full of regard and honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius; \\n How he received you, let me be resolved. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n With courtesy and with respect enough; \\n But not with such familiar instances, \\n Nor with such free and friendly conference, \\n As he hath used of old. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Thou hast described \\n A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius, \\n When love begins to sicken and decay, \\n It useth an enforced ceremony. \\n There are no tricks in plain and simple faith; \\n But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, \\n Make gallant show and promise of their mettle; \\n But when they should endure the bloody spur, \\n They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades, \\n Sink in the trial. Comes his army on? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd; \\n The greater part, the horse in general, \\n Are come with Cassius. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Hark! he is arrived. \\n Low march within \\n March gently on to meet him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CASSIUS and his powers \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Stand, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Stand, ho! Speak the word along. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n Stand! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Soldier \\n Stand! \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Soldier \\n Stand! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Most noble brother, you have done me wrong. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies? \\n And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs; \\n And when you do them-- \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Cassius, be content. \\n Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well. \\n Before the eyes of both our armies here, \\n Which should perceive nothing but love from us, \\n Let us not wrangle: bid them move away; \\n Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs, \\n And I will give you audience. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Pindarus, \\n Bid our commanders lead their charges off \\n A little from this ground. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man \\n Come to our tent till we have done our conference. \\n Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Brutus's tent. \\n Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this: \\n You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella \\n For taking bribes here of the Sardians; \\n Wherein my letters, praying on his side, \\n Because I knew the man, were slighted off. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n You wronged yourself to write in such a case. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n In such a time as this it is not meet \\n That every nice offence should bear his comment. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself \\n Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm; \\n To sell and mart your offices for gold \\n To undeservers. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I an itching palm! \\n You know that you are Brutus that speak this, \\n Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n The name of Cassius honours this corruption, \\n And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Chastisement! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Remember March, the ides of March remember: \\n Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake? \\n What villain touch'd his body, that did stab, \\n And not for justice? What, shall one of us \\n That struck the foremost man of all this world \\n But for supporting robbers, shall we now \\n Contaminate our fingers with base bribes, \\n And sell the mighty space of our large honours \\n For so much trash as may be grasped thus? \\n I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, \\n Than such a Roman. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Brutus, bay not me; \\n I'll not endure it: you forget yourself, \\n To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I, \\n Older in practise, abler than yourself \\n To make conditions. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Go to; you are not, Cassius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I am. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I say you are not. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Urge me no more, I shall forget myself; \\n Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Away, slight man! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Is't possible? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Hear me, for I will speak. \\n Must I give way and room to your rash choler? \\n Shall I be frighted when a madman stares? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break; \\n Go show your slaves how choleric you are, \\n And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge? \\n Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch \\n Under your testy humour? By the gods \\n You shall digest the venom of your spleen, \\n Though it do split you; for, from this day forth, \\n I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, \\n When you are waspish. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Is it come to this? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n You say you are a better soldier: \\n Let it appear so; make your vaunting true, \\n And it shall please me well: for mine own part, \\n I shall be glad to learn of noble men. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus; \\n I said, an elder soldier, not a better: \\n Did I say 'better'? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n If you did, I care not. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I durst not! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n No. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n What, durst not tempt him! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n For your life you durst not! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Do not presume too much upon my love; \\n I may do that I shall be sorry for. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n You have done that you should be sorry for. \\n There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, \\n For I am arm'd so strong in honesty \\n That they pass by me as the idle wind, \\n Which I respect not. I did send to you \\n For certain sums of gold, which you denied me: \\n For I can raise no money by vile means: \\n By heaven, I had rather coin my heart, \\n And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring \\n From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash \\n By any indirection: I did send \\n To you for gold to pay my legions, \\n Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius? \\n Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so? \\n When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous, \\n To lock such rascal counters from his friends, \\n Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts; \\n Dash him to pieces! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I denied you not. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n You did. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I did not: he was but a fool that brought \\n My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart: \\n A friend should bear his friend's infirmities, \\n But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I do not, till you practise them on me. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n You love me not. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I do not like your faults. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n A friendly eye could never see such faults. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n A flatterer's would not, though they do appear \\n As huge as high Olympus. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come, \\n Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, \\n For Cassius is aweary of the world; \\n Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother; \\n Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed, \\n Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote, \\n To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep \\n My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger, \\n And here my naked breast; within, a heart \\n Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold: \\n If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth; \\n I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart: \\n Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know, \\n When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better \\n Than ever thou lovedst Cassius. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Sheathe your dagger: \\n Be angry when you will, it shall have scope; \\n Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour. \\n O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb \\n That carries anger as the flint bears fire; \\n Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark, \\n And straight is cold again. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Hath Cassius lived \\n To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus, \\n When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Do you confess so much? Give me your hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n And my heart too. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n O Brutus! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Have not you love enough to bear with me, \\n When that rash humour which my mother gave me \\n Makes me forgetful? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth, \\n When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, \\n He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so. \\n \\n\\n \\n Poet \\n Within   Let me go in to see the generals; \\n There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet \\n They be alone. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n Within   You shall not come to them. \\n \\n\\n \\n Poet \\n Within   Nothing but death shall stay me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n How now! what's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n Poet \\n For shame, you generals! what do you mean? \\n Love, and be friends, as two such men should be; \\n For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I'll know his humour, when he knows his time: \\n What should the wars do with these jigging fools? \\n Companion, hence! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Away, away, be gone. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Poet \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders \\n Prepare to lodge their companies to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you \\n Immediately to us. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Lucius, a bowl of wine! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit LUCIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I did not think you could have been so angry. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Of your philosophy you make no use, \\n If you give place to accidental evils. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Ha! Portia! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n She is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so? \\n O insupportable and touching loss! \\n Upon what sickness? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Impatient of my absence, \\n And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony \\n Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death \\n That tidings came;--with this she fell distract, \\n And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n And died so? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Even so. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n O ye immortal gods! \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine. \\n In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge. \\n Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup; \\n I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Come in, Titinius! \\n Exit LUCIUS \\n Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA \\n Welcome, good Messala. \\n Now sit we close about this taper here, \\n And call in question our necessities. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Portia, art thou gone? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n No more, I pray you. \\n Messala, I have here received letters, \\n That young Octavius and Mark Antony \\n Come down upon us with a mighty power, \\n Bending their expedition toward Philippi. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n With what addition? \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n That by proscription and bills of outlawry, \\n Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus, \\n Have put to death an hundred senators. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Therein our letters do not well agree; \\n Mine speak of seventy senators that died \\n By their proscriptions, Cicero being one. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Cicero one! \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Cicero is dead, \\n And by that order of proscription. \\n Had you your letters from your wife, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n No, Messala. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Nor nothing in your letters writ of her? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Nothing, Messala. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n That, methinks, is strange. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours? \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n No, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell: \\n For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala: \\n With meditating that she must die once, \\n I have the patience to endure it now. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Even so great men great losses should endure. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I have as much of this in art as you, \\n But yet my nature could not bear it so. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Well, to our work alive. What do you think \\n Of marching to Philippi presently? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I do not think it good. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Your reason? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n This it is: \\n 'Tis better that the enemy seek us: \\n So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, \\n Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still, \\n Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Good reasons must, of force, give place to better. \\n The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground \\n Do stand but in a forced affection; \\n For they have grudged us contribution: \\n The enemy, marching along by them, \\n By them shall make a fuller number up, \\n Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged; \\n From which advantage shall we cut him off, \\n If at Philippi we do face him there, \\n These people at our back. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Hear me, good brother. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Under your pardon. You must note beside, \\n That we have tried the utmost of our friends, \\n Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe: \\n The enemy increaseth every day; \\n We, at the height, are ready to decline. \\n There is a tide in the affairs of men, \\n Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; \\n Omitted, all the voyage of their life \\n Is bound in shallows and in miseries. \\n On such a full sea are we now afloat; \\n And we must take the current when it serves, \\n Or lose our ventures. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Then, with your will, go on; \\n We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n The deep of night is crept upon our talk, \\n And nature must obey necessity; \\n Which we will niggard with a little rest. \\n There is no more to say? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n No more. Good night: \\n Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Lucius! \\n Enter LUCIUS \\n My gown. \\n Exit LUCIUS \\n Farewell, good Messala: \\n Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius, \\n Good night, and good repose. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n O my dear brother! \\n This was an ill beginning of the night: \\n Never come such division 'tween our souls! \\n Let it not, Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Every thing is well. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Good night, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Good night, good brother. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n MESSALA \\n Good night, Lord Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Farewell, every one. \\n Exeunt all but BRUTUS \\n Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown \\n Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Here in the tent. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n What, thou speak'st drowsily? \\n Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd. \\n Call Claudius and some other of my men: \\n I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Varro and Claudius! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS \\n\\n \\n VARRO \\n Calls my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep; \\n It may be I shall raise you by and by \\n On business to my brother Cassius. \\n \\n\\n \\n VARRO \\n So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs; \\n It may be I shall otherwise bethink me. \\n Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so; \\n I put it in the pocket of my gown. \\n \\n\\n\\n VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n I was sure your lordship did not give it me. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful. \\n Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile, \\n And touch thy instrument a strain or two? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Ay, my lord, an't please you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n It does, my boy: \\n I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n It is my duty, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n I should not urge thy duty past thy might; \\n I know young bloods look for a time of rest. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n I have slept, my lord, already. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again; \\n I will not hold thee long: if I do live, \\n I will be good to thee. \\n Music, and a song \\n This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber, \\n Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy, \\n That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night; \\n I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee: \\n If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument; \\n I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night. \\n Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down \\n Where I left reading? Here it is, I think. \\n Enter the Ghost of CAESAR \\n How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here? \\n I think it is the weakness of mine eyes \\n That shapes this monstrous apparition. \\n It comes upon me. Art thou any thing? \\n Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil, \\n That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare? \\n Speak to me what thou art. \\n \\n\\n \\n GHOST \\n Thy evil spirit, Brutus. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why comest thou? \\n \\n\\n \\n GHOST \\n To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Well; then I shall see thee again? \\n \\n\\n \\n GHOST \\n Ay, at Philippi. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then. \\n Exit Ghost \\n Now I have taken heart thou vanishest: \\n Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee. \\n Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius! \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n The strings, my lord, are false. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n He thinks he still is at his instrument. \\n Lucius, awake! \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n My lord, I do not know that I did cry. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCIUS \\n Nothing, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius! \\n To VARRO \\n Fellow thou, awake! \\n \\n\\n \\n VARRO \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLAUDIUS \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep? \\n \\n\\n \\n VARRO \\n CLAUDIUS \\n Did we, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Ay: saw you any thing? \\n \\n\\n \\n VARRO \\n No, my lord, I saw nothing. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLAUDIUS \\n Nor I, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Go and commend me to my brother Cassius; \\n Bid him set on his powers betimes before, \\n And we will follow. \\n \\n\\n \\n VARRO \\n CLAUDIUS \\n It shall be done, my lord. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT V \\n\\n SCENE I.  The plains of Philippi. \\n Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Now, Antony, our hopes are answered: \\n You said the enemy would not come down, \\n But keep the hills and upper regions; \\n It proves not so: their battles are at hand; \\n They mean to warn us at Philippi here, \\n Answering before we do demand of them. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know \\n Wherefore they do it: they could be content \\n To visit other places; and come down \\n With fearful bravery, thinking by this face \\n To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage; \\n But 'tis not so. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Messenger \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Prepare you, generals: \\n The enemy comes on in gallant show; \\n Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, \\n And something to be done immediately. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Octavius, lead your battle softly on, \\n Upon the left hand of the even field. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Why do you cross me in this exigent? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n I do not cross you; but I will do so. \\n \\n\\n March \\n Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army;\\nLUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n They stand, and would have parley. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge. \\n Make forth; the generals would have some words. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Stir not until the signal. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Words before blows: is it so, countrymen? \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Not that we love words better, as you do. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words: \\n Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart, \\n Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!' \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Antony, \\n The posture of your blows are yet unknown; \\n But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees, \\n And leave them honeyless. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Not stingless too. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O, yes, and soundless too; \\n For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony, \\n And very wisely threat before you sting. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers \\n Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar: \\n You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds, \\n And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet; \\n Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind \\n Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself: \\n This tongue had not offended so to-day, \\n If Cassius might have ruled. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat, \\n The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look; \\n I draw a sword against conspirators; \\n When think you that the sword goes up again? \\n Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds \\n Be well avenged; or till another Caesar \\n Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands, \\n Unless thou bring'st them with thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n So I hope; \\n I was not born to die on Brutus' sword. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, \\n Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour, \\n Join'd with a masker and a reveller! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Old Cassius still! \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Come, Antony, away! \\n Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth: \\n If you dare fight to-day, come to the field; \\n If not, when you have stomachs. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark! \\n The storm is up, and all is on the hazard. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n Standing forth  My lord? \\n \\n\\n\\n BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Messala! \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Standing forth   What says my general? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Messala, \\n This is my birth-day; as this very day \\n Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala: \\n Be thou my witness that against my will, \\n As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set \\n Upon one battle all our liberties. \\n You know that I held Epicurus strong \\n And his opinion: now I change my mind, \\n And partly credit things that do presage. \\n Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign \\n Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd, \\n Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands; \\n Who to Philippi here consorted us: \\n This morning are they fled away and gone; \\n And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites, \\n Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us, \\n As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem \\n A canopy most fatal, under which \\n Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Believe not so. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n I but believe it partly; \\n For I am fresh of spirit and resolved \\n To meet all perils very constantly. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Even so, Lucilius. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Now, most noble Brutus, \\n The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may, \\n Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age! \\n But since the affairs of men rest still incertain, \\n Let's reason with the worst that may befall. \\n If we do lose this battle, then is this \\n The very last time we shall speak together: \\n What are you then determined to do? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Even by the rule of that philosophy \\n By which I did blame Cato for the death \\n Which he did give himself, I know not how, \\n But I do find it cowardly and vile, \\n For fear of what might fall, so to prevent \\n The time of life: arming myself with patience \\n To stay the providence of some high powers \\n That govern us below. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Then, if we lose this battle, \\n You are contented to be led in triumph \\n Thorough the streets of Rome? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman, \\n That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome; \\n He bears too great a mind. But this same day \\n Must end that work the ides of March begun; \\n And whether we shall meet again I know not. \\n Therefore our everlasting farewell take: \\n For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius! \\n If we do meet again, why, we shall smile; \\n If not, why then, this parting was well made. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus! \\n If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed; \\n If not, 'tis true this parting was well made. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know \\n The end of this day's business ere it come! \\n But it sufficeth that the day will end, \\n And then the end is known. Come, ho! away! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  The same. The field of battle. \\n Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills \\n Unto the legions on the other side. \\n Loud alarum \\n Let them set on at once; for I perceive \\n But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing, \\n And sudden push gives them the overthrow. \\n Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Another part of the field. \\n Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly! \\n Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy: \\n This ensign here of mine was turning back; \\n I slew the coward, and did take it from him. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early; \\n Who, having some advantage on Octavius, \\n Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil, \\n Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter PINDARUS \\n\\n \\n PINDARUS \\n Fly further off, my lord, fly further off; \\n Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord \\n Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius; \\n Are those my tents where I perceive the fire? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n They are, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Titinius, if thou lovest me, \\n Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him, \\n Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops, \\n And here again; that I may rest assured \\n Whether yond troops are friend or enemy. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n I will be here again, even with a thought. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill; \\n My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius, \\n And tell me what thou notest about the field. \\n PINDARUS ascends the hill \\n This day I breathed first: time is come round, \\n And where I did begin, there shall I end; \\n My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news? \\n \\n\\n \\n PINDARUS \\n Above   O my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n What news? \\n \\n\\n \\n PINDARUS \\n Above   Titinius is enclosed round about \\n With horsemen, that make to him on the spur; \\n Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him. \\n Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too. \\n He's ta'en. \\n Shout \\n And, hark! they shout for joy. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIUS \\n Come down, behold no more. \\n O, coward that I am, to live so long, \\n To see my best friend ta'en before my face! \\n PINDARUS descends \\n Come hither, sirrah: \\n In Parthia did I take thee prisoner; \\n And then I swore thee, saving of thy life, \\n That whatsoever I did bid thee do, \\n Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath; \\n Now be a freeman: and with this good sword, \\n That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom. \\n Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts; \\n And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now, \\n Guide thou the sword. \\n PINDARUS stabs him \\n Caesar, thou art revenged, \\n Even with the sword that kill'd thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n PINDARUS \\n So, I am free; yet would not so have been, \\n Durst I have done my will. O Cassius, \\n Far from this country Pindarus shall run, \\n Where never Roman shall take note of him. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius \\n Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power, \\n As Cassius' legions are by Antony. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n These tidings will well comfort Cassius. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Where did you leave him? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n All disconsolate, \\n With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Is not that he that lies upon the ground? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n He lies not like the living. O my heart! \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Is not that he? \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n No, this was he, Messala, \\n But Cassius is no more. O setting sun, \\n As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night, \\n So in his red blood Cassius' day is set; \\n The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone; \\n Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done! \\n Mistrust of my success hath done this deed. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Mistrust of good success hath done this deed. \\n O hateful error, melancholy's child, \\n Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men \\n The things that are not? O error, soon conceived, \\n Thou never comest unto a happy birth, \\n But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus? \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet \\n The noble Brutus, thrusting this report \\n Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it; \\n For piercing steel and darts envenomed \\n Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus \\n As tidings of this sight. \\n \\n\\n \\n TITINIUS \\n Hie you, Messala, \\n And I will seek for Pindarus the while. \\n Exit MESSALA \\n Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius? \\n Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they \\n Put on my brows this wreath of victory, \\n And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts? \\n Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing! \\n But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow; \\n Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I \\n Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace, \\n And see how I regarded Caius Cassius. \\n By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part \\n Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart. \\n \\n\\n Kills himself \\n Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO,\\nSTRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie? \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Titinius' face is upward. \\n \\n\\n \\n CATO \\n He is slain. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet! \\n Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords \\n In our own proper entrails. \\n \\n\\n\\n Low alarums \\n\\n \\n CATO \\n Brave Titinius! \\n Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Are yet two Romans living such as these? \\n The last of all the Romans, fare thee well! \\n It is impossible that ever Rome \\n Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears \\n To this dead man than you shall see me pay. \\n I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time. \\n Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body: \\n His funerals shall not be in our camp, \\n Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come; \\n And come, young Cato; let us to the field. \\n Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on: \\n 'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night \\n We shall try fortune in a second fight. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Another part of the field. \\n Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies;\\nthen BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads! \\n \\n\\n \\n CATO \\n What bastard doth not? Who will go with me? \\n I will proclaim my name about the field: \\n I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! \\n A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend; \\n I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I; \\n Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n O young and noble Cato, art thou down? \\n Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius; \\n And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n Yield, or thou diest. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n Only I yield to die: \\n There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight; \\n Offering money \\n Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n We must not. A noble prisoner! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Soldier \\n Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Soldier \\n I'll tell the news. Here comes the general. \\n Enter ANTONY \\n Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n Where is he? \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough: \\n I dare assure thee that no enemy \\n Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus: \\n The gods defend him from so great a shame! \\n When you do find him, or alive or dead, \\n He will be found like Brutus, like himself. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you, \\n A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe; \\n Give him all kindness: I had rather have \\n Such men my friends than enemies. Go on, \\n And see whether Brutus be alive or dead; \\n And bring us word unto Octavius' tent \\n How every thing is chanced. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Another part of the field. \\n Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and\\nVOLUMNIUS \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord, \\n He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word; \\n It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus. \\n \\n\\n\\n Whispers \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Peace then! no words. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n I'll rather kill myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Hark thee, Dardanius. \\n \\n\\n\\n Whispers \\n\\n \\n DARDANIUS \\n Shall I do such a deed? \\n \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n O Dardanius! \\n \\n\\n \\n DARDANIUS \\n O Clitus! \\n \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n What ill request did Brutus make to thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n DARDANIUS \\n To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates. \\n \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n Now is that noble vessel full of grief, \\n That it runs over even at his eyes. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word. \\n \\n\\n \\n VOLUMNIUS \\n What says my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Why, this, Volumnius: \\n The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me \\n Two several times by night; at Sardis once, \\n And, this last night, here in Philippi fields: \\n I know my hour is come. \\n \\n\\n \\n VOLUMNIUS \\n Not so, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius. \\n Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes; \\n Our enemies have beat us to the pit: \\n Low alarums \\n It is more worthy to leap in ourselves, \\n Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius, \\n Thou know'st that we two went to school together: \\n Even for that our love of old, I prithee, \\n Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it. \\n \\n\\n \\n VOLUMNIUS \\n That's not an office for a friend, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Alarum still \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius. \\n Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep; \\n Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen, \\n My heart doth joy that yet in all my life \\n I found no man but he was true to me. \\n I shall have glory by this losing day \\n More than Octavius and Mark Antony \\n By this vile conquest shall attain unto. \\n So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue \\n Hath almost ended his life's history: \\n Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest, \\n That have but labour'd to attain this hour. \\n \\n\\n\\n Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!' \\n\\n \\n CLITUS \\n Fly, my lord, fly. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Hence! I will follow. \\n Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS \\n I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord: \\n Thou art a fellow of a good respect; \\n Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it: \\n Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face, \\n While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato? \\n \\n\\n \\n STRATO \\n Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRUTUS \\n Farewell, good Strato. \\n Runs on his sword \\n Caesar, now be still: \\n I kill'd not thee with half so good a will. \\n \\n\\n Dies \\n Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,\\nLUCILIUS, and the army \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n What man is that? \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n My master's man. Strato, where is thy master? \\n \\n\\n \\n STRATO \\n Free from the bondage you are in, Messala: \\n The conquerors can but make a fire of him; \\n For Brutus only overcame himself, \\n And no man else hath honour by his death. \\n \\n\\n \\n LUCILIUS \\n So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus, \\n That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n All that served Brutus, I will entertain them. \\n Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me? \\n \\n\\n \\n STRATO \\n Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n Do so, good Messala. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n How died my master, Strato? \\n \\n\\n \\n STRATO \\n I held the sword, and he did run on it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MESSALA \\n Octavius, then take him to follow thee, \\n That did the latest service to my master. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONY \\n This was the noblest Roman of them all: \\n All the conspirators save only he \\n Did that they did in envy of great Caesar; \\n He only, in a general honest thought \\n And common good to all, made one of them. \\n His life was gentle, and the elements \\n So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up \\n And say to all the world 'This was a man!' \\n \\n\\n \\n OCTAVIUS \\n According to his virtue let us use him, \\n With all respect and rites of burial. \\n Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie, \\n Most like a soldier, order'd honourably. \\n So call the field to rest; and let's away, \\n To part the glories of this happy day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n TITLE \\n\\n\\n\\n The Tragedy of Macbeth \\n\\n\\n\\n PERSONAE \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dramatis Personae \\n\\n DUNCAN, king of Scotland. \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n DONALBAIN \\n his sons. \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n BANQUO \\n generals of the king's army. \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n LENNOX \\n ROSS \\n MENTEITH \\n ANGUS \\n CAITHNESS \\n noblemen of Scotland. \\n \\n\\n FLEANCE, son to Banquo. \\n SIWARD, Earl of Northumberland, general of the English forces. \\n YOUNG SIWARD, his son. \\n SEYTON, an officer attending on Macbeth. \\n Boy, son to Macduff.  \\n An English Doctor.  \\n A Scotch Doctor.  \\n A Soldier. \\n A Porter. \\n An Old Man. \\n LADY MACBETH \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Gentlewoman attending on Lady Macbeth.  \\n HECATE \\n Three Witches. \\n Apparitions. \\n Lords, Gentlemen, Officers, Soldiers, Murderers, Attendants, and Messengers.  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n SCNDESCR \\n\\n\\n\\n SCENE  Scotland: England. \\n\\n\\n\\n PLAYSUBT \\n\\n\\n\\n MACBETH \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT I \\n\\n SCENE I.

He can report, \\n As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt \\n The newest state. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n This is the sergeant \\n Who like a good and hardy soldier fought \\n 'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend! \\n Say to the king the knowledge of the broil \\n As thou didst leave it. \\n \\n\\n \\n Sergeant \\n Doubtful it stood; \\n As two spent swimmers, that do cling together \\n And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-- \\n Worthy to be a rebel, for to that \\n The multiplying villanies of nature \\n Do swarm upon him--from the western isles \\n Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied; \\n And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling, \\n Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak: \\n For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name-- \\n Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel, \\n Which smoked with bloody execution, \\n Like valour's minion carved out his passage \\n Till he faced the slave; \\n Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, \\n Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps, \\n And fix'd his head upon our battlements. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman! \\n \\n\\n \\n Sergeant \\n As whence the sun 'gins his reflection \\n Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, \\n So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come \\n Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark: \\n No sooner justice had with valour arm'd \\n Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels, \\n But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage, \\n With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men \\n Began a fresh assault. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n Dismay'd not this \\n Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? \\n \\n\\n \\n Sergeant \\n Yes; \\n As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. \\n If I say sooth, I must report they were \\n As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they \\n Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe: \\n Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, \\n Or memorise another Golgotha, \\n I cannot tell. \\n But I am faint, my gashes cry for help. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; \\n They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons. \\n Exit Sergeant, attended \\n Who comes here? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROSS \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n The worthy thane of Ross. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look \\n That seems to speak things strange. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n God save the king! \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n Whence camest thou, worthy thane? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n From Fife, great king; \\n Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky \\n And fan our people cold. Norway himself, \\n With terrible numbers, \\n Assisted by that most disloyal traitor \\n The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict; \\n Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof, \\n Confronted him with self-comparisons, \\n Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm. \\n Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude, \\n The victory fell on us. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n Great happiness! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n That now \\n Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition: \\n Nor would we deign him burial of his men \\n Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch \\n Ten thousand dollars to our general use. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive \\n Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death, \\n And with his former title greet Macbeth. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n I'll see it done. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.

What are these \\n So wither'd and so wild in their attire, \\n That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth, \\n And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught \\n That man may question? You seem to understand me, \\n By each at once her chappy finger laying \\n Upon her skinny lips: you should be women, \\n And yet your beards forbid me to interpret \\n That you are so. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Speak, if you can: what are you? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Witch \\n All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter! \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear \\n Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth, \\n Are ye fantastical, or that indeed \\n Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner \\n You greet with present grace and great prediction \\n Of noble having and of royal hope, \\n That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not. \\n If you can look into the seeds of time, \\n And say which grain will grow and which will not, \\n Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear \\n Your favours nor your hate. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n Hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Witch \\n Hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Lesser than Macbeth, and greater. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n Not so happy, yet much happier. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Witch \\n Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none: \\n So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more: \\n By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis; \\n But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives, \\n A prosperous gentleman; and to be king \\n Stands not within the prospect of belief, \\n No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence \\n You owe this strange intelligence? or why \\n Upon this blasted heath you stop our way \\n With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Witches vanish \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, \\n And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted \\n As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd! \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Were such things here as we do speak about? \\n Or have we eaten on the insane root \\n That takes the reason prisoner? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Your children shall be kings. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n You shall be king. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so? \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROSS and ANGUS \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n The king hath happily received, Macbeth, \\n The news of thy success; and when he reads \\n Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, \\n His wonders and his praises do contend \\n Which should be thine or his: silenced with that, \\n In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day, \\n He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, \\n Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, \\n Strange images of death. As thick as hail \\n Came post with post; and every one did bear \\n Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence, \\n And pour'd them down before him. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANGUS \\n We are sent \\n To give thee from our royal master thanks; \\n Only to herald thee into his sight, \\n Not pay thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n And, for an earnest of a greater honour, \\n He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: \\n In which addition, hail, most worthy thane! \\n For it is thine. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n What, can the devil speak true? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me \\n In borrow'd robes? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANGUS \\n Who was the thane lives yet; \\n But under heavy judgment bears that life \\n Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined \\n With those of Norway, or did line the rebel \\n With hidden help and vantage, or that with both \\n He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not; \\n But treasons capital, confess'd and proved, \\n Have overthrown him. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Aside   Glamis, and thane of Cawdor! \\n The greatest is behind. \\n To ROSS and ANGUS \\n Thanks for your pains. \\n To BANQUO \\n Do you not hope your children shall be kings, \\n When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me \\n Promised no less to them? \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n That trusted home \\n Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, \\n Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange: \\n And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, \\n The instruments of darkness tell us truths, \\n Win us with honest trifles, to betray's \\n In deepest consequence. \\n Cousins, a word, I pray you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Aside  Two truths are told, \\n As happy prologues to the swelling act \\n Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen. \\n Aside   This supernatural soliciting \\n Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill, \\n Why hath it given me earnest of success, \\n Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor: \\n If good, why do I yield to that suggestion \\n Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair \\n And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, \\n Against the use of nature? Present fears \\n Are less than horrible imaginings: \\n My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical, \\n Shakes so my single state of man that function \\n Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is \\n But what is not. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Look, how our partner's rapt. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Aside   If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, \\n Without my stir. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n New horrors come upon him, \\n Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould \\n But with the aid of use. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Aside                 Come what come may, \\n Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought \\n With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains \\n Are register'd where every day I turn \\n The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king. \\n Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time, \\n The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak \\n Our free hearts each to other. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Very gladly. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Till then, enough. Come, friends. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Forres. The palace. \\n Flourish.

But I have spoke \\n With one that saw him die: who did report \\n That very frankly he confess'd his treasons, \\n Implored your highness' pardon and set forth \\n A deep repentance: nothing in his life \\n Became him like the leaving it; he died \\n As one that had been studied in his death \\n To throw away the dearest thing he owed, \\n As 'twere a careless trifle. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n There's no art \\n To find the mind's construction in the face: \\n He was a gentleman on whom I built \\n An absolute trust. \\n Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS \\n O worthiest cousin! \\n The sin of my ingratitude even now \\n Was heavy on me: thou art so far before \\n That swiftest wing of recompense is slow \\n To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved, \\n That the proportion both of thanks and payment \\n Might have been mine! only I have left to say, \\n More is thy due than more than all can pay. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n The service and the loyalty I owe, \\n In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part \\n Is to receive our duties; and our duties \\n Are to your throne and state children and servants, \\n Which do but what they should, by doing every thing \\n Safe toward your love and honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n Welcome hither: \\n I have begun to plant thee, and will labour \\n To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo, \\n That hast no less deserved, nor must be known \\n No less to have done so, let me enfold thee \\n And hold thee to my heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n There if I grow, \\n The harvest is your own. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n My plenteous joys, \\n Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves \\n In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes, \\n And you whose places are the nearest, know \\n We will establish our estate upon \\n Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter \\n The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must \\n Not unaccompanied invest him only, \\n But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine \\n On all deservers. From hence to Inverness, \\n And bind us further to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n The rest is labour, which is not used for you: \\n I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful \\n The hearing of my wife with your approach; \\n So humbly take my leave. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n My worthy Cawdor! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Aside   The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step \\n On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, \\n For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; \\n Let not light see my black and deep desires: \\n The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be, \\n Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant, \\n And in his commendations I am fed; \\n It is a banquet to me. Let's after him, \\n Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome: \\n It is a peerless kinsman. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish. Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Inverness. Macbeth's castle. \\n Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n 'They met me in the day of success: and I have \\n learned by the perfectest report, they have more in \\n them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire \\n to question them further, they made themselves air, \\n into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in \\n the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who \\n all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title, \\n before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred \\n me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that \\n shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver \\n thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou \\n mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being \\n ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it \\n to thy heart, and farewell.' \\n Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be \\n What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature; \\n It is too full o' the milk of human kindness \\n To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great; \\n Art not without ambition, but without \\n The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly, \\n That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, \\n And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis, \\n That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it; \\n And that which rather thou dost fear to do \\n Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither, \\n That I may pour my spirits in thine ear; \\n And chastise with the valour of my tongue \\n All that impedes thee from the golden round, \\n Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem \\n To have thee crown'd withal. \\n Enter a Messenger \\n What is your tidings? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n The king comes here to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Thou'rt mad to say it: \\n Is not thy master with him? who, were't so, \\n Would have inform'd for preparation. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n So please you, it is true: our thane is coming: \\n One of my fellows had the speed of him, \\n Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more \\n Than would make up his message. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Give him tending; \\n He brings great news. \\n Exit Messenger \\n The raven himself is hoarse \\n That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan \\n Under my battlements. Come, you spirits \\n That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, \\n And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full \\n Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood; \\n Stop up the access and passage to remorse, \\n That no compunctious visitings of nature \\n Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between \\n The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, \\n And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers, \\n Wherever in your sightless substances \\n You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night, \\n And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, \\n That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, \\n Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark, \\n To cry 'Hold, hold!' \\n Enter MACBETH \\n Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor! \\n Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter! \\n Thy letters have transported me beyond \\n This ignorant present, and I feel now \\n The future in the instant. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n My dearest love, \\n Duncan comes here to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n And when goes hence? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n To-morrow, as he purposes. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n O, never \\n Shall sun that morrow see! \\n Your face, my thane, is as a book where men \\n May read strange matters. To beguile the time, \\n Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye, \\n Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower, \\n But be the serpent under't. He that's coming \\n Must be provided for: and you shall put \\n This night's great business into my dispatch; \\n Which shall to all our nights and days to come \\n Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n We will speak further. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Only look up clear; \\n To alter favour ever is to fear: \\n Leave all the rest to me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Before Macbeth's castle. \\n Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM,\\nDONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS,\\nand Attendants \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air \\n Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself \\n Unto our gentle senses. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n This guest of summer, \\n The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, \\n By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath \\n Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, \\n Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird \\n Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle: \\n Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, \\n The air is delicate. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LADY MACBETH \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n See, see, our honour'd hostess! \\n The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, \\n Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you \\n How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains, \\n And thank us for your trouble. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n All our service \\n In every point twice done and then done double \\n Were poor and single business to contend \\n Against those honours deep and broad wherewith \\n Your majesty loads our house: for those of old, \\n And the late dignities heap'd up to them, \\n We rest your hermits. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n Where's the thane of Cawdor? \\n We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose \\n To be his purveyor: but he rides well; \\n And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him \\n To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess, \\n We are your guest to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Your servants ever \\n Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt, \\n To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, \\n Still to return your own. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUNCAN \\n Give me your hand; \\n Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly, \\n And shall continue our graces towards him. \\n By your leave, hostess. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VII.  Macbeth's castle. \\n Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers\\nServants with dishes and service, and pass over the\\nstage. Then enter MACBETH \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well \\n It were done quickly: if the assassination \\n Could trammel up the consequence, and catch \\n With his surcease success; that but this blow \\n Might be the be-all and the end-all here, \\n But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, \\n We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases \\n We still have judgment here; that we but teach \\n Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return \\n To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice \\n Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice \\n To our own lips. He's here in double trust; \\n First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, \\n Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, \\n Who should against his murderer shut the door, \\n Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan \\n Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been \\n So clear in his great office, that his virtues \\n Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against \\n The deep damnation of his taking-off; \\n And pity, like a naked new-born babe, \\n Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed \\n Upon the sightless couriers of the air, \\n Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, \\n That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur \\n To prick the sides of my intent, but only \\n Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself \\n And falls on the other. \\n Enter LADY MACBETH \\n How now! what news? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Hath he ask'd for me? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Know you not he has? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n We will proceed no further in this business: \\n He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought \\n Golden opinions from all sorts of people, \\n Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, \\n Not cast aside so soon. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Was the hope drunk \\n Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since? \\n And wakes it now, to look so green and pale \\n At what it did so freely? From this time \\n Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard \\n To be the same in thine own act and valour \\n As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that \\n Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, \\n And live a coward in thine own esteem, \\n Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' \\n Like the poor cat i' the adage? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Prithee, peace: \\n I dare do all that may become a man; \\n Who dares do more is none. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n What beast was't, then, \\n That made you break this enterprise to me? \\n When you durst do it, then you were a man; \\n And, to be more than what you were, you would \\n Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place \\n Did then adhere, and yet you would make both: \\n They have made themselves, and that their fitness now \\n Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know \\n How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me: \\n I would, while it was smiling in my face, \\n Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums, \\n And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you \\n Have done to this. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n If we should fail? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n We fail! \\n But screw your courage to the sticking-place, \\n And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep-- \\n Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey \\n Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains \\n Will I with wine and wassail so convince \\n That memory, the warder of the brain, \\n Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason \\n A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep \\n Their drenched natures lie as in a death, \\n What cannot you and I perform upon \\n The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon \\n His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt \\n Of our great quell? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Bring forth men-children only; \\n For thy undaunted mettle should compose \\n Nothing but males. Will it not be received, \\n When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two \\n Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, \\n That they have done't? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Who dares receive it other, \\n As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar \\n Upon his death? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I am settled, and bend up \\n Each corporal agent to this terrible feat. \\n Away, and mock the time with fairest show: \\n False face must hide what the false heart doth know. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT II \\n\\n SCENE I.  Court of Macbeth's castle. \\n Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n How goes the night, boy? \\n \\n\\n \\n FLEANCE \\n The moon is down; I have not heard the clock. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n And she goes down at twelve. \\n \\n\\n \\n FLEANCE \\n I take't, 'tis later, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven; \\n Their candles are all out. Take thee that too. \\n A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, \\n And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers, \\n Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature \\n Gives way to in repose! \\n Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch \\n Give me my sword. \\n Who's there? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n A friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed: \\n He hath been in unusual pleasure, and \\n Sent forth great largess to your offices. \\n This diamond he greets your wife withal, \\n By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up \\n In measureless content. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Being unprepared, \\n Our will became the servant to defect; \\n Which else should free have wrought. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n All's well. \\n I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: \\n To you they have show'd some truth. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I think not of them: \\n Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, \\n We would spend it in some words upon that business, \\n If you would grant the time. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n At your kind'st leisure. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, \\n It shall make honour for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n So I lose none \\n In seeking to augment it, but still keep \\n My bosom franchised and allegiance clear, \\n I shall be counsell'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Good repose the while! \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Thanks, sir: the like to you! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, \\n She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. \\n Exit Servant \\n Is this a dagger which I see before me, \\n The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. \\n I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. \\n Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible \\n To feeling as to sight? or art thou but \\n A dagger of the mind, a false creation, \\n Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? \\n I see thee yet, in form as palpable \\n As this which now I draw. \\n Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going; \\n And such an instrument I was to use. \\n Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, \\n Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still, \\n And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, \\n Which was not so before. There's no such thing: \\n It is the bloody business which informs \\n Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld \\n Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse \\n The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates \\n Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder, \\n Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, \\n Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace. \\n With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design \\n Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, \\n Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear \\n Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, \\n And take the present horror from the time, \\n Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives: \\n Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. \\n A bell rings \\n I go, and it is done; the bell invites me. \\n Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell \\n That summons thee to heaven or to hell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  The same. \\n Enter LADY MACBETH \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; \\n What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. \\n Hark! Peace! \\n It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, \\n Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it: \\n The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms \\n Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd \\n their possets, \\n That death and nature do contend about them, \\n Whether they live or die. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Within   Who's there? what, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Alack, I am afraid they have awaked, \\n And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed \\n Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; \\n He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled \\n My father as he slept, I had done't. \\n Enter MACBETH \\n My husband! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. \\n Did not you speak? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n When? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Now. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n As I descended? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Ay. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Hark! \\n Who lies i' the second chamber? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Donalbain. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n This is a sorry sight. \\n \\n\\n\\n Looking on his hands \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried \\n 'Murder!' \\n That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them: \\n But they did say their prayers, and address'd them \\n Again to sleep. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n There are two lodged together. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other; \\n As they had seen me with these hangman's hands. \\n Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,' \\n When they did say 'God bless us!' \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Consider it not so deeply. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'? \\n I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen' \\n Stuck in my throat. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n These deeds must not be thought \\n After these ways; so, it will make us mad. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more! \\n Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep, \\n Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care, \\n The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, \\n Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, \\n Chief nourisher in life's feast,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n What do you mean? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house: \\n 'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor \\n Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.' \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, \\n You do unbend your noble strength, to think \\n So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, \\n And wash this filthy witness from your hand. \\n Why did you bring these daggers from the place? \\n They must lie there: go carry them; and smear \\n The sleepy grooms with blood. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I'll go no more: \\n I am afraid to think what I have done; \\n Look on't again I dare not. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Infirm of purpose! \\n Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead \\n Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood \\n That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, \\n I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal; \\n For it must seem their guilt. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit. Knocking within \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Whence is that knocking? \\n How is't with me, when every noise appals me? \\n What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes. \\n Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood \\n Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather \\n The multitudinous seas in incarnadine, \\n Making the green one red. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter LADY MACBETH \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n My hands are of your colour; but I shame \\n To wear a heart so white. \\n Knocking within \\n I hear a knocking \\n At the south entry: retire we to our chamber; \\n A little water clears us of this deed: \\n How easy is it, then! Your constancy \\n Hath left you unattended. \\n Knocking within \\n Hark! more knocking. \\n Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us, \\n And show us to be watchers. Be not lost \\n So poorly in your thoughts. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself. \\n Knocking within \\n Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  The same. \\n Knocking within. Enter a Porter \\n\\n \\n Porter \\n Here's a knocking indeed! If a \\n man were porter of hell-gate, he should have \\n old turning the key. \\n Knocking within \\n Knock, \\n knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of \\n Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged \\n himself on the expectation of plenty: come in \\n time; have napkins enow about you; here \\n you'll sweat for't. \\n Knocking within \\n Knock, \\n knock! Who's there, in the other devil's \\n name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could \\n swear in both the scales against either scale; \\n who committed treason enough for God's sake, \\n yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come \\n in, equivocator. \\n Knocking within \\n Knock, \\n knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an \\n English tailor come hither, for stealing out of \\n a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may \\n roast your goose. \\n Knocking within \\n Knock, \\n knock; never at quiet! What are you? But \\n this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter \\n it no further: I had thought to have let in \\n some of all professions that go the primrose \\n way to the everlasting bonfire. \\n Knocking within \\n Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter. \\n \\n\\n Opens the gate \\n Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, \\n That you do lie so late? \\n \\n\\n \\n Porter \\n 'Faith sir, we were carousing till the \\n second cock: and drink, sir, is a great \\n provoker of three things. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n What three things does drink especially provoke? \\n \\n\\n \\n Porter \\n Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and \\n urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; \\n it provokes the desire, but it takes \\n away the performance: therefore, much drink \\n may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: \\n it makes him, and it mars him; it sets \\n him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, \\n and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and \\n not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him \\n in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n I believe drink gave thee the lie last night. \\n \\n\\n \\n Porter \\n That it did, sir, i' the very throat on \\n me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I \\n think, being too strong for him, though he took \\n up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast \\n him. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Is thy master stirring? \\n Enter MACBETH \\n Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Good morrow, noble sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Good morrow, both. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Is the king stirring, worthy thane? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Not yet. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n He did command me to call timely on him: \\n I have almost slipp'd the hour. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I'll bring you to him. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n I know this is a joyful trouble to you; \\n But yet 'tis one. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n The labour we delight in physics pain. \\n This is the door. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n I'll make so bold to call, \\n For 'tis my limited service. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Goes the king hence to-day? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n He does: he did appoint so. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n The night has been unruly: where we lay, \\n Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say, \\n Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death, \\n And prophesying with accents terrible \\n Of dire combustion and confused events \\n New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird \\n Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth \\n Was feverous and did shake. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n 'Twas a rough night. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n My young remembrance cannot parallel \\n A fellow to it. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter MACDUFF \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart \\n Cannot conceive nor name thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n LENNOX \\n What's the matter. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Confusion now hath made his masterpiece! \\n Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope \\n The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence \\n The life o' the building! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n What is 't you say? the life? \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Mean you his majesty? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight \\n With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak; \\n See, and then speak yourselves. \\n Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX \\n Awake, awake! \\n Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason! \\n Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake! \\n Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, \\n And look on death itself! up, up, and see \\n The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo! \\n As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, \\n To countenance this horror! Ring the bell. \\n \\n\\n Bell rings \\n Enter LADY MACBETH \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n What's the business, \\n That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley \\n The sleepers of the house? speak, speak! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n O gentle lady, \\n 'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: \\n The repetition, in a woman's ear, \\n Would murder as it fell. \\n Enter BANQUO \\n O Banquo, Banquo, \\n Our royal master 's murder'd! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Woe, alas! \\n What, in our house? \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Too cruel any where. \\n Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, \\n And say it is not so. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Had I but died an hour before this chance, \\n I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant, \\n There 's nothing serious in mortality: \\n All is but toys: renown and grace is dead; \\n The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees \\n Is left this vault to brag of. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN \\n\\n \\n DONALBAIN \\n What is amiss? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n You are, and do not know't: \\n The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood \\n Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Your royal father 's murder'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n O, by whom? \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't: \\n Their hands and faces were an badged with blood; \\n So were their daggers, which unwiped we found \\n Upon their pillows: \\n They stared, and were distracted; no man's life \\n Was to be trusted with them. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n O, yet I do repent me of my fury, \\n That I did kill them. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Wherefore did you so? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious, \\n Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man: \\n The expedition my violent love \\n Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, \\n His silver skin laced with his golden blood; \\n And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature \\n For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers, \\n Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers \\n Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain, \\n That had a heart to love, and in that heart \\n Courage to make 's love known? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Help me hence, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Look to the lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Aside to DONALBAIN   Why do we hold our tongues, \\n That most may claim this argument for ours? \\n \\n\\n \\n DONALBAIN \\n Aside to MALCOLM   What should be spoken here, \\n where our fate, \\n Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us? \\n Let 's away; \\n Our tears are not yet brew'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Aside to DONALBAIN         Nor our strong sorrow \\n Upon the foot of motion. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Look to the lady: \\n LADY MACBETH is carried out \\n And when we have our naked frailties hid, \\n That suffer in exposure, let us meet, \\n And question this most bloody piece of work, \\n To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us: \\n In the great hand of God I stand; and thence \\n Against the undivulged pretence I fight \\n Of treasonous malice. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n And so do I. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n So all. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Let's briefly put on manly readiness, \\n And meet i' the hall together. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Well contented. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n What will you do? Let's not consort with them: \\n To show an unfelt sorrow is an office \\n Which the false man does easy. I'll to England. \\n \\n\\n \\n DONALBAIN \\n To Ireland, I; our separated fortune \\n Shall keep us both the safer: where we are, \\n There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood, \\n The nearer bloody. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n This murderous shaft that's shot \\n Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way \\n Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse; \\n And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, \\n But shift away: there's warrant in that theft \\n Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Outside Macbeth's castle. \\n Enter ROSS and an old Man \\n\\n \\n Old Man \\n Threescore and ten I can remember well: \\n Within the volume of which time I have seen \\n Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night \\n Hath trifled former knowings. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Ah, good father, \\n Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act, \\n Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day, \\n And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp: \\n Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame, \\n That darkness does the face of earth entomb, \\n When living light should kiss it? \\n \\n\\n \\n Old Man \\n 'Tis unnatural, \\n Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last, \\n A falcon, towering in her pride of place, \\n Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain-- \\n Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, \\n Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, \\n Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make \\n War with mankind. \\n \\n\\n \\n Old Man \\n 'Tis said they eat each other. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes \\n That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff. \\n Enter MACDUFF \\n How goes the world, sir, now? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Why, see you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Is't known who did this more than bloody deed? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Those that Macbeth hath slain. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Alas, the day! \\n What good could they pretend? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n They were suborn'd: \\n Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons, \\n Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them \\n Suspicion of the deed. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n 'Gainst nature still! \\n Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up \\n Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like \\n The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n He is already named, and gone to Scone \\n To be invested. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Where is Duncan's body? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Carried to Colmekill, \\n The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, \\n And guardian of their bones. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Will you to Scone? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n No, cousin, I'll to Fife. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Well, I will thither. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Well, may you see things well done there: adieu! \\n Lest our old robes sit easier than our new! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Farewell, father. \\n \\n\\n \\n Old Man \\n God's benison go with you; and with those \\n That would make good of bad, and friends of foes! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.  Forres. The palace. \\n Enter BANQUO \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all, \\n As the weird women promised, and, I fear, \\n Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said \\n It should not stand in thy posterity, \\n But that myself should be the root and father \\n Of many kings. If there come truth from them-- \\n As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine-- \\n Why, by the verities on thee made good, \\n May they not be my oracles as well, \\n And set me up in hope? But hush! no more. \\n \\n\\n\\n Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY\\nMACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and\\nAttendants \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Here's our chief guest. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n If he had been forgotten, \\n It had been as a gap in our great feast, \\n And all-thing unbecoming. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n To-night we hold a solemn supper sir, \\n And I'll request your presence. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Let your highness \\n Command upon me; to the which my duties \\n Are with a most indissoluble tie \\n For ever knit. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Ride you this afternoon? \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Ay, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n We should have else desired your good advice, \\n Which still hath been both grave and prosperous, \\n In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow. \\n Is't far you ride? \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n As far, my lord, as will fill up the time \\n 'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better, \\n I must become a borrower of the night \\n For a dark hour or twain. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Fail not our feast. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n My lord, I will not. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd \\n In England and in Ireland, not confessing \\n Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers \\n With strange invention: but of that to-morrow, \\n When therewithal we shall have cause of state \\n Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu, \\n Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you? \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I wish your horses swift and sure of foot; \\n And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell. \\n Exit BANQUO \\n Let every man be master of his time \\n Till seven at night: to make society \\n The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself \\n Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you! \\n Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant \\n Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men \\n Our pleasure? \\n \\n\\n \\n ATTENDANT \\n They are, my lord, without the palace gate. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Bring them before us. \\n Exit Attendant \\n To be thus is nothing; \\n But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo \\n Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature \\n Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares; \\n And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, \\n He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour \\n To act in safety. There is none but he \\n Whose being I do fear: and, under him, \\n My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said, \\n Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters \\n When first they put the name of king upon me, \\n And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like \\n They hail'd him father to a line of kings: \\n Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown, \\n And put a barren sceptre in my gripe, \\n Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, \\n No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so, \\n For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind; \\n For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd; \\n Put rancours in the vessel of my peace \\n Only for them; and mine eternal jewel \\n Given to the common enemy of man, \\n To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! \\n Rather than so, come fate into the list. \\n And champion me to the utterance! Who's there! \\n Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers \\n Now go to the door, and stay there till we call. \\n Exit Attendant \\n Was it not yesterday we spoke together? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n It was, so please your highness. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Well then, now \\n Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know \\n That it was he in the times past which held you \\n So under fortune, which you thought had been \\n Our innocent self: this I made good to you \\n In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you, \\n How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, \\n the instruments, \\n Who wrought with them, and all things else that might \\n To half a soul and to a notion crazed \\n Say 'Thus did Banquo.' \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n You made it known to us. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I did so, and went further, which is now \\n Our point of second meeting. Do you find \\n Your patience so predominant in your nature \\n That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd \\n To pray for this good man and for his issue, \\n Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave \\n And beggar'd yours for ever? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n We are men, my liege. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men; \\n As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, \\n Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept \\n All by the name of dogs: the valued file \\n Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, \\n The housekeeper, the hunter, every one \\n According to the gift which bounteous nature \\n Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive \\n Particular addition. from the bill \\n That writes them all alike: and so of men. \\n Now, if you have a station in the file, \\n Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't; \\n And I will put that business in your bosoms, \\n Whose execution takes your enemy off, \\n Grapples you to the heart and love of us, \\n Who wear our health but sickly in his life, \\n Which in his death were perfect. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Murderer \\n I am one, my liege, \\n Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world \\n Have so incensed that I am reckless what \\n I do to spite the world. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n And I another \\n So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune, \\n That I would set my lie on any chance, \\n To mend it, or be rid on't. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Both of you \\n Know Banquo was your enemy. \\n \\n\\n \\n Both Murderers \\n True, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n So is he mine; and in such bloody distance, \\n That every minute of his being thrusts \\n Against my near'st of life: and though I could \\n With barefaced power sweep him from my sight \\n And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, \\n For certain friends that are both his and mine, \\n Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall \\n Who I myself struck down; and thence it is, \\n That I to your assistance do make love, \\n Masking the business from the common eye \\n For sundry weighty reasons. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Murderer \\n We shall, my lord, \\n Perform what you command us. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Though our lives-- \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most \\n I will advise you where to plant yourselves; \\n Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, \\n The moment on't; for't must be done to-night, \\n And something from the palace; always thought \\n That I require a clearness: and with him-- \\n To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-- \\n Fleance his son, that keeps him company, \\n Whose absence is no less material to me \\n Than is his father's, must embrace the fate \\n Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart: \\n I'll come to you anon. \\n \\n\\n \\n Both Murderers \\n We are resolved, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I'll call upon you straight: abide within. \\n Exeunt Murderers \\n It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight, \\n If it find heaven, must find it out to-night. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  The palace. \\n Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Is Banquo gone from court? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Ay, madam, but returns again to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Say to the king, I would attend his leisure \\n For a few words. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Madam, I will. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Nought's had, all's spent, \\n Where our desire is got without content: \\n 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy \\n Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. \\n Enter MACBETH \\n How now, my lord! why do you keep alone, \\n Of sorriest fancies your companions making, \\n Using those thoughts which should indeed have died \\n With them they think on? Things without all remedy \\n Should be without regard: what's done is done. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it: \\n She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice \\n Remains in danger of her former tooth. \\n But let the frame of things disjoint, both the \\n worlds suffer, \\n Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep \\n In the affliction of these terrible dreams \\n That shake us nightly: better be with the dead, \\n Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, \\n Than on the torture of the mind to lie \\n In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; \\n After life's fitful fever he sleeps well; \\n Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, \\n Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, \\n Can touch him further. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Come on; \\n Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks; \\n Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you: \\n Let your remembrance apply to Banquo; \\n Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: \\n Unsafe the while, that we \\n Must lave our honours in these flattering streams, \\n And make our faces vizards to our hearts, \\n Disguising what they are. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n You must leave this. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! \\n Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n But in them nature's copy's not eterne. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n There's comfort yet; they are assailable; \\n Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown \\n His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons \\n The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums \\n Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done \\n A deed of dreadful note. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n What's to be done? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, \\n Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, \\n Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day; \\n And with thy bloody and invisible hand \\n Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond \\n Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow \\n Makes wing to the rooky wood: \\n Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; \\n While night's black agents to their preys do rouse. \\n Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still; \\n Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. \\n So, prithee, go with me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A park near the palace. \\n Enter three Murderers \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n But who did bid thee join with us? \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Murderer \\n Macbeth. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Murderer \\n He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers \\n Our offices and what we have to do \\n To the direction just. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Then stand with us. \\n The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day: \\n Now spurs the lated traveller apace \\n To gain the timely inn; and near approaches \\n The subject of our watch. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Murderer \\n Hark! I hear horses. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n Within   Give us a light there, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Murderer \\n Then 'tis he: the rest \\n That are within the note of expectation \\n Already are i' the court. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n His horses go about. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Murderer \\n Almost a mile: but he does usually, \\n So all men do, from hence to the palace gate \\n Make it their walk. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Murderer \\n A light, a light! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch \\n\\n \\n Third Murderer \\n 'Tis he. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Stand to't. \\n \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n It will be rain to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Let it come down. \\n \\n\\n\\n They set upon BANQUO \\n\\n \\n BANQUO \\n O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! \\n Thou mayst revenge. O slave! \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies. FLEANCE escapes \\n\\n \\n Third Murderer \\n Who did strike out the light? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Wast not the way? \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Murderer \\n There's but one down; the son is fled. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Murderer \\n We have lost \\n Best half of our affair. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Well, let's away, and say how much is done. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  The same. Hall in the palace. \\n A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH,\\nROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n You know your own degrees; sit down: at first \\n And last the hearty welcome. \\n \\n\\n \\n Lords \\n Thanks to your majesty. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Ourself will mingle with society, \\n And play the humble host. \\n Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time \\n We will require her welcome. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends; \\n For my heart speaks they are welcome. \\n \\n\\n\\n First Murderer appears at the door \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks. \\n Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst: \\n Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure \\n The table round. \\n Approaching the door \\n There's blood on thy face. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n 'Tis Banquo's then. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n 'Tis better thee without than he within. \\n Is he dispatch'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good \\n That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it, \\n Thou art the nonpareil. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Most royal sir, \\n Fleance is 'scaped. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect, \\n Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, \\n As broad and general as the casing air: \\n But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in \\n To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides, \\n With twenty trenched gashes on his head; \\n The least a death to nature. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Thanks for that: \\n There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled \\n Hath nature that in time will venom breed, \\n No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow \\n We'll hear, ourselves, again. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Murderer \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n My royal lord, \\n You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold \\n That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making, \\n 'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home; \\n From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; \\n Meeting were bare without it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Sweet remembrancer! \\n Now, good digestion wait on appetite, \\n And health on both! \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n May't please your highness sit. \\n \\n\\n\\n The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in\\nMACBETH's place \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Here had we now our country's honour roof'd, \\n Were the graced person of our Banquo present; \\n Who may I rather challenge for unkindness \\n Than pity for mischance! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n His absence, sir, \\n Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness \\n To grace us with your royal company. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n The table's full. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Here is a place reserved, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Where? \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Which of you have done this? \\n \\n\\n \\n Lords \\n What, my good lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Thou canst not say I did it: never shake \\n Thy gory locks at me. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus, \\n And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; \\n The fit is momentary; upon a thought \\n He will again be well: if much you note him, \\n You shall offend him and extend his passion: \\n Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that \\n Which might appal the devil. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n O proper stuff! \\n This is the very painting of your fear: \\n This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said, \\n Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts, \\n Impostors to true fear, would well become \\n A woman's story at a winter's fire, \\n Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! \\n Why do you make such faces? When all's done, \\n You look but on a stool. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! \\n how say you? \\n Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too. \\n If charnel-houses and our graves must send \\n Those that we bury back, our monuments \\n Shall be the maws of kites. \\n \\n\\n\\n GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n What, quite unmann'd in folly? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n If I stand here, I saw him. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Fie, for shame! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, \\n Ere human statute purged the gentle weal; \\n Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd \\n Too terrible for the ear: the times have been, \\n That, when the brains were out, the man would die, \\n And there an end; but now they rise again, \\n With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, \\n And push us from our stools: this is more strange \\n Than such a murder is. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n My worthy lord, \\n Your noble friends do lack you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I do forget. \\n Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends, \\n I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing \\n To those that know me. Come, love and health to all; \\n Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full. \\n I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, \\n And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss; \\n Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst, \\n And all to all. \\n \\n\\n \\n Lords \\n Our duties, and the pledge. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! \\n Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; \\n Thou hast no speculation in those eyes \\n Which thou dost glare with! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Think of this, good peers, \\n But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other; \\n Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n What man dare, I dare: \\n Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, \\n The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger; \\n Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves \\n Shall never tremble: or be alive again, \\n And dare me to the desert with thy sword; \\n If trembling I inhabit then, protest me \\n The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! \\n Unreal mockery, hence! \\n GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes \\n Why, so: being gone, \\n I am a man again. Pray you, sit still. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, \\n With most admired disorder. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Can such things be, \\n And overcome us like a summer's cloud, \\n Without our special wonder? You make me strange \\n Even to the disposition that I owe, \\n When now I think you can behold such sights, \\n And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, \\n When mine is blanched with fear. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n What sights, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; \\n Question enrages him. At once, good night: \\n Stand not upon the order of your going, \\n But go at once. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Good night; and better health \\n Attend his majesty! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n A kind good night to all! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood: \\n Stones have been known to move and trees to speak; \\n Augurs and understood relations have \\n By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth \\n The secret'st man of blood. What is the night? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Almost at odds with morning, which is which. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person \\n At our great bidding? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Did you send to him, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I hear it by the way; but I will send: \\n There's not a one of them but in his house \\n I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow, \\n And betimes I will, to the weird sisters: \\n More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know, \\n By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, \\n All causes shall give way: I am in blood \\n Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, \\n Returning were as tedious as go o'er: \\n Strange things I have in head, that will to hand; \\n Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n You lack the season of all natures, sleep. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse \\n Is the initiate fear that wants hard use: \\n We are yet but young in deed. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  A Heath. \\n Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly. \\n \\n\\n \\n HECATE \\n Have I not reason, beldams as you are, \\n Saucy and overbold? How did you dare \\n To trade and traffic with Macbeth \\n In riddles and affairs of death; \\n And I, the mistress of your charms, \\n The close contriver of all harms, \\n Was never call'd to bear my part, \\n Or show the glory of our art? \\n And, which is worse, all you have done \\n Hath been but for a wayward son, \\n Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, \\n Loves for his own ends, not for you. \\n But make amends now: get you gone, \\n And at the pit of Acheron \\n Meet me i' the morning: thither he \\n Will come to know his destiny: \\n Your vessels and your spells provide, \\n Your charms and every thing beside. \\n I am for the air; this night I'll spend \\n Unto a dismal and a fatal end: \\n Great business must be wrought ere noon: \\n Upon the corner of the moon \\n There hangs a vaporous drop profound; \\n I'll catch it ere it come to ground: \\n And that distill'd by magic sleights \\n Shall raise such artificial sprites \\n As by the strength of their illusion \\n Shall draw him on to his confusion: \\n He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear \\n He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear: \\n And you all know, security \\n Is mortals' chiefest enemy. \\n Music and a song within: 'Come away, come\\naway,' &c \\n Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see, \\n Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Forres. The palace. \\n Enter LENNOX and another Lord \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n My former speeches have but hit your thoughts, \\n Which can interpret further: only, I say, \\n Things have been strangely borne. The \\n gracious Duncan \\n Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead: \\n And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late; \\n Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd, \\n For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late. \\n Who cannot want the thought how monstrous \\n It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain \\n To kill their gracious father? damned fact! \\n How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight \\n In pious rage the two delinquents tear, \\n That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? \\n Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; \\n For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive \\n To hear the men deny't. So that, I say, \\n He has borne all things well: and I do think \\n That had he Duncan's sons under his key-- \\n As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they \\n should find \\n What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. \\n But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd \\n His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear \\n Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell \\n Where he bestows himself? \\n \\n\\n \\n Lord \\n The son of Duncan, \\n From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth \\n Lives in the English court, and is received \\n Of the most pious Edward with such grace \\n That the malevolence of fortune nothing \\n Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff \\n Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid \\n To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward: \\n That, by the help of these--with Him above \\n To ratify the work--we may again \\n Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights, \\n Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, \\n Do faithful homage and receive free honours: \\n All which we pine for now: and this report \\n Hath so exasperate the king that he \\n Prepares for some attempt of war. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Sent he to Macduff? \\n \\n\\n \\n Lord \\n He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,' \\n The cloudy messenger turns me his back, \\n And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time \\n That clogs me with this answer.' \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n And that well might \\n Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance \\n His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel \\n Fly to the court of England and unfold \\n His message ere he come, that a swift blessing \\n May soon return to this our suffering country \\n Under a hand accursed! \\n \\n\\n \\n Lord \\n I'll send my prayers with him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT IV \\n\\n SCENE I.  A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. \\n Thunder. Enter the three Witches \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Witch \\n Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Round about the cauldron go; \\n In the poison'd entrails throw. \\n Toad, that under cold stone \\n Days and nights has thirty-one \\n Swelter'd venom sleeping got, \\n Boil thou first i' the charmed pot. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Double, double toil and trouble; \\n Fire burn, and cauldron bubble. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n Fillet of a fenny snake, \\n In the cauldron boil and bake; \\n Eye of newt and toe of frog, \\n Wool of bat and tongue of dog, \\n Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting, \\n Lizard's leg and owlet's wing, \\n For a charm of powerful trouble, \\n Like a hell-broth boil and bubble. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Double, double toil and trouble; \\n Fire burn and cauldron bubble. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Witch \\n Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, \\n Witches' mummy, maw and gulf \\n Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark, \\n Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark, \\n Liver of blaspheming Jew, \\n Gall of goat, and slips of yew \\n Silver'd in the moon's eclipse, \\n Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips, \\n Finger of birth-strangled babe \\n Ditch-deliver'd by a drab, \\n Make the gruel thick and slab: \\n Add thereto a tiger's chaudron, \\n For the ingredients of our cauldron. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Double, double toil and trouble; \\n Fire burn and cauldron bubble. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n Cool it with a baboon's blood, \\n Then the charm is firm and good. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter HECATE to the other three Witches \\n\\n \\n HECATE \\n O well done! I commend your pains; \\n And every one shall share i' the gains; \\n And now about the cauldron sing, \\n Live elves and fairies in a ring, \\n Enchanting all that you put in. \\n \\n\\n Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' &c \\n HECATE retires \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n By the pricking of my thumbs, \\n Something wicked this way comes. \\n Open, locks, \\n Whoever knocks! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MACBETH \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! \\n What is't you do? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n A deed without a name. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I conjure you, by that which you profess, \\n Howe'er you come to know it, answer me: \\n Though you untie the winds and let them fight \\n Against the churches; though the yesty waves \\n Confound and swallow navigation up; \\n Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down; \\n Though castles topple on their warders' heads; \\n Though palaces and pyramids do slope \\n Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure \\n Of nature's germens tumble all together, \\n Even till destruction sicken; answer me \\n To what I ask you. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n Demand. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Witch \\n We'll answer. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths, \\n Or from our masters? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Call 'em; let me see 'em. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten \\n Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten \\n From the murderer's gibbet throw \\n Into the flame. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Come, high or low; \\n Thyself and office deftly show! \\n \\n\\n\\n Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Tell me, thou unknown power,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n He knows thy thought: \\n Hear his speech, but say thou nought. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Apparition \\n Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff; \\n Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough. \\n \\n\\n\\n Descends \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks; \\n Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one \\n word more,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n He will not be commanded: here's another, \\n More potent than the first. \\n \\n\\n\\n Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child \\n\\n \\n Second Apparition \\n Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Apparition \\n Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn \\n The power of man, for none of woman born \\n Shall harm Macbeth. \\n \\n\\n\\n Descends \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee? \\n But yet I'll make assurance double sure, \\n And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live; \\n That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies, \\n And sleep in spite of thunder. \\n Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,\\nwith a tree in his hand \\n What is this \\n That rises like the issue of a king, \\n And wears upon his baby-brow the round \\n And top of sovereignty? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Listen, but speak not to't. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Apparition \\n Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care \\n Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are: \\n Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until \\n Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill \\n Shall come against him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Descends \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n That will never be \\n Who can impress the forest, bid the tree \\n Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good! \\n Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood \\n Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth \\n Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath \\n To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart \\n Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art \\n Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever \\n Reign in this kingdom? \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Seek to know no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I will be satisfied: deny me this, \\n And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know. \\n Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this? \\n \\n\\n\\n Hautboys \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Show! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Witch \\n Show! \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Witch \\n Show! \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Show his eyes, and grieve his heart; \\n Come like shadows, so depart! \\n \\n\\n\\n A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in\\nhis hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down! \\n Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair, \\n Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first. \\n A third is like the former. Filthy hags! \\n Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes! \\n What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? \\n Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more: \\n And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass \\n Which shows me many more; and some I see \\n That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry: \\n Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true; \\n For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, \\n And points at them for his. \\n Apparitions vanish \\n What, is this so? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Witch \\n Ay, sir, all this is so: but why \\n Stands Macbeth thus amazedly? \\n Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites, \\n And show the best of our delights: \\n I'll charm the air to give a sound, \\n While you perform your antic round: \\n That this great king may kindly say, \\n Our duties did his welcome pay. \\n \\n\\n\\n Music. The witches dance and then vanish,\\nwith HECATE \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour \\n Stand aye accursed in the calendar! \\n Come in, without there! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LENNOX \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n What's your grace's will? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Saw you the weird sisters? \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n No, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Came they not by you? \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n No, indeed, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Infected be the air whereon they ride; \\n And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear \\n The galloping of horse: who was't came by? \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n 'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word \\n Macduff is fled to England. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Fled to England! \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Ay, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits: \\n The flighty purpose never is o'ertook \\n Unless the deed go with it; from this moment \\n The very firstlings of my heart shall be \\n The firstlings of my hand. And even now, \\n To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done: \\n The castle of Macduff I will surprise; \\n Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword \\n His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls \\n That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool; \\n This deed I'll do before this purpose cool. \\n But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen? \\n Come, bring me where they are. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Fife. Macduff's castle. \\n Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n What had he done, to make him fly the land? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n You must have patience, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n He had none: \\n His flight was madness: when our actions do not, \\n Our fears do make us traitors. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n You know not \\n Whether it was his wisdom or his fear. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes, \\n His mansion and his titles in a place \\n From whence himself does fly? He loves us not; \\n He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren, \\n The most diminutive of birds, will fight, \\n Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. \\n All is the fear and nothing is the love; \\n As little is the wisdom, where the flight \\n So runs against all reason. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n My dearest coz, \\n I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband, \\n He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows \\n The fits o' the season. I dare not speak \\n much further; \\n But cruel are the times, when we are traitors \\n And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour \\n From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, \\n But float upon a wild and violent sea \\n Each way and move. I take my leave of you: \\n Shall not be long but I'll be here again: \\n Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward \\n To what they were before. My pretty cousin, \\n Blessing upon you! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n I am so much a fool, should I stay longer, \\n It would be my disgrace and your discomfort: \\n I take my leave at once. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Sirrah, your father's dead; \\n And what will you do now? How will you live? \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n As birds do, mother. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n What, with worms and flies? \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n With what I get, I mean; and so do they. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime, \\n The pitfall nor the gin. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for. \\n My father is not dead, for all your saying. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father? \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n Nay, how will you do for a husband? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Why, I can buy me twenty at any market. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n Then you'll buy 'em to sell again. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith, \\n With wit enough for thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n Was my father a traitor, mother? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Ay, that he was. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n What is a traitor? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Why, one that swears and lies. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n And be all traitors that do so? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Every one. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n Who must hang them? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Why, the honest men. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n Then the liars and swearers are fools, \\n for there are liars and swearers enow to beat \\n the honest men and hang up them. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Now, God help thee, poor monkey! \\n But how wilt thou do for a father? \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n If he were dead, you'ld weep for \\n him: if you would not, it were a good sign \\n that I should quickly have a new father. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Poor prattler, how thou talk'st! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Messenger \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known, \\n Though in your state of honour I am perfect. \\n I doubt some danger does approach you nearly: \\n If you will take a homely man's advice, \\n Be not found here; hence, with your little ones. \\n To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage; \\n To do worse to you were fell cruelty, \\n Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! \\n I dare abide no longer. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n Whither should I fly? \\n I have done no harm. But I remember now \\n I am in this earthly world; where to do harm \\n Is often laudable, to do good sometime \\n Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas, \\n Do I put up that womanly defence, \\n To say I have done no harm? \\n Enter Murderers \\n What are these faces? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n Where is your husband? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACDUFF \\n I hope, in no place so unsanctified \\n Where such as thou mayst find him. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n He's a traitor. \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Murderer \\n What, you egg! \\n Stabbing him \\n Young fry of treachery! \\n \\n\\n \\n Son \\n He has kill'd me, mother: \\n Run away, I pray you! \\n \\n\\n Dies \\n Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt\\nMurderers, following her \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  England. Before the King's palace. \\n Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there \\n Weep our sad bosoms empty. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Let us rather \\n Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men \\n Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn \\n New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows \\n Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds \\n As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out \\n Like syllable of dolour. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n What I believe I'll wail, \\n What know believe, and what I can redress, \\n As I shall find the time to friend, I will. \\n What you have spoke, it may be so perchance. \\n This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, \\n Was once thought honest: you have loved him well. \\n He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young; \\n but something \\n You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom \\n To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb \\n To appease an angry god. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n I am not treacherous. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n But Macbeth is. \\n A good and virtuous nature may recoil \\n In an imperial charge. But I shall crave \\n your pardon; \\n That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose: \\n Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell; \\n Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, \\n Yet grace must still look so. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n I have lost my hopes. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Perchance even there where I did find my doubts. \\n Why in that rawness left you wife and child, \\n Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, \\n Without leave-taking? I pray you, \\n Let not my jealousies be your dishonours, \\n But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just, \\n Whatever I shall think. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Bleed, bleed, poor country! \\n Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure, \\n For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou \\n thy wrongs; \\n The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord: \\n I would not be the villain that thou think'st \\n For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp, \\n And the rich East to boot. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Be not offended: \\n I speak not as in absolute fear of you. \\n I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; \\n It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash \\n Is added to her wounds: I think withal \\n There would be hands uplifted in my right; \\n And here from gracious England have I offer \\n Of goodly thousands: but, for all this, \\n When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, \\n Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country \\n Shall have more vices than it had before, \\n More suffer and more sundry ways than ever, \\n By him that shall succeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n What should he be? \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n It is myself I mean: in whom I know \\n All the particulars of vice so grafted \\n That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth \\n Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state \\n Esteem him as a lamb, being compared \\n With my confineless harms. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Not in the legions \\n Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd \\n In evils to top Macbeth. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n I grant him bloody, \\n Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, \\n Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin \\n That has a name: but there's no bottom, none, \\n In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters, \\n Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up \\n The cistern of my lust, and my desire \\n All continent impediments would o'erbear \\n That did oppose my will: better Macbeth \\n Than such an one to reign. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Boundless intemperance \\n In nature is a tyranny; it hath been \\n The untimely emptying of the happy throne \\n And fall of many kings. But fear not yet \\n To take upon you what is yours: you may \\n Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty, \\n And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink. \\n We have willing dames enough: there cannot be \\n That vulture in you, to devour so many \\n As will to greatness dedicate themselves, \\n Finding it so inclined. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n With this there grows \\n In my most ill-composed affection such \\n A stanchless avarice that, were I king, \\n I should cut off the nobles for their lands, \\n Desire his jewels and this other's house: \\n And my more-having would be as a sauce \\n To make me hunger more; that I should forge \\n Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, \\n Destroying them for wealth. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n This avarice \\n Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root \\n Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been \\n The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear; \\n Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will. \\n Of your mere own: all these are portable, \\n With other graces weigh'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n But I have none: the king-becoming graces, \\n As justice, verity, temperance, stableness, \\n Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, \\n Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, \\n I have no relish of them, but abound \\n In the division of each several crime, \\n Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should \\n Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, \\n Uproar the universal peace, confound \\n All unity on earth. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n O Scotland, Scotland! \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n If such a one be fit to govern, speak: \\n I am as I have spoken. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Fit to govern! \\n No, not to live. O nation miserable, \\n With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd, \\n When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, \\n Since that the truest issue of thy throne \\n By his own interdiction stands accursed, \\n And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father \\n Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee, \\n Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, \\n Died every day she lived. Fare thee well! \\n These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself \\n Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast, \\n Thy hope ends here! \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Macduff, this noble passion, \\n Child of integrity, hath from my soul \\n Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts \\n To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth \\n By many of these trains hath sought to win me \\n Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me \\n From over-credulous haste: but God above \\n Deal between thee and me! for even now \\n I put myself to thy direction, and \\n Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure \\n The taints and blames I laid upon myself, \\n For strangers to my nature. I am yet \\n Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, \\n Scarcely have coveted what was mine own, \\n At no time broke my faith, would not betray \\n The devil to his fellow and delight \\n No less in truth than life: my first false speaking \\n Was this upon myself: what I am truly, \\n Is thine and my poor country's to command: \\n Whither indeed, before thy here-approach, \\n Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, \\n Already at a point, was setting forth. \\n Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness \\n Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Such welcome and unwelcome things at once \\n 'Tis hard to reconcile. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Doctor \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you? \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls \\n That stay his cure: their malady convinces \\n The great assay of art; but at his touch-- \\n Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand-- \\n They presently amend. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n I thank you, doctor. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Doctor \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n What's the disease he means? \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n 'Tis call'd the evil: \\n A most miraculous work in this good king; \\n Which often, since my here-remain in England, \\n I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven, \\n Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people, \\n All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, \\n The mere despair of surgery, he cures, \\n Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, \\n Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken, \\n To the succeeding royalty he leaves \\n The healing benediction. With this strange virtue, \\n He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, \\n And sundry blessings hang about his throne, \\n That speak him full of grace. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROSS \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n See, who comes here? \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n My countryman; but yet I know him not. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n I know him now. Good God, betimes remove \\n The means that makes us strangers! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Sir, amen. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Stands Scotland where it did? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Alas, poor country! \\n Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot \\n Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing, \\n But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; \\n Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air \\n Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems \\n A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell \\n Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives \\n Expire before the flowers in their caps, \\n Dying or ere they sicken. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n O, relation \\n Too nice, and yet too true! \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n What's the newest grief? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker: \\n Each minute teems a new one. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n How does my wife? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Why, well. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n And all my children? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Well too. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n When I came hither to transport the tidings, \\n Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour \\n Of many worthy fellows that were out; \\n Which was to my belief witness'd the rather, \\n For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot: \\n Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland \\n Would create soldiers, make our women fight, \\n To doff their dire distresses. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Be't their comfort \\n We are coming thither: gracious England hath \\n Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; \\n An older and a better soldier none \\n That Christendom gives out. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Would I could answer \\n This comfort with the like! But I have words \\n That would be howl'd out in the desert air, \\n Where hearing should not latch them. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n What concern they? \\n The general cause? or is it a fee-grief \\n Due to some single breast? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n No mind that's honest \\n But in it shares some woe; though the main part \\n Pertains to you alone. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n If it be mine, \\n Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, \\n Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound \\n That ever yet they heard. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Hum! I guess at it. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes \\n Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner, \\n Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer, \\n To add the death of you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Merciful heaven! \\n What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows; \\n Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak \\n Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n My children too? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Wife, children, servants, all \\n That could be found. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n And I must be from thence! \\n My wife kill'd too? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n I have said. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Be comforted: \\n Let's make us medicines of our great revenge, \\n To cure this deadly grief. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n He has no children. All my pretty ones? \\n Did you say all? O hell-kite! All? \\n What, all my pretty chickens and their dam \\n At one fell swoop? \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Dispute it like a man. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n I shall do so; \\n But I must also feel it as a man: \\n I cannot but remember such things were, \\n That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on, \\n And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff, \\n They were all struck for thee! naught that I am, \\n Not for their own demerits, but for mine, \\n Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now! \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief \\n Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n O, I could play the woman with mine eyes \\n And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, \\n Cut short all intermission; front to front \\n Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; \\n Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape, \\n Heaven forgive him too! \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n This tune goes manly. \\n Come, go we to the king; our power is ready; \\n Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth \\n Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above \\n Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may: \\n The night is long that never finds the day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT V \\n\\n SCENE I.  Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle. \\n Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive \\n no truth in your report. When was it she last walked? \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen \\n her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon \\n her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, \\n write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again \\n return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once \\n the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of \\n watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her \\n walking and other actual performances, what, at any \\n time, have you heard her say? \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n That, sir, which I will not report after her. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should. \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to \\n confirm my speech. \\n Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper \\n Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; \\n and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n How came she by that light? \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n Why, it stood by her: she has light by her \\n continually; 'tis her command. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n You see, her eyes are open. \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n Ay, but their sense is shut. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands. \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus \\n washing her hands: I have known her continue in \\n this a quarter of an hour. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Yet here's a spot. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from \\n her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why, \\n then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my \\n lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we \\n fear who knows it, when none can call our power to \\n account?--Yet who would have thought the old man \\n to have had so much blood in him. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Do you mark that? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?-- \\n What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o' \\n that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with \\n this starting. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Go to, go to; you have known what you should not. \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of \\n that: heaven knows what she has known. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Here's the smell of the blood still: all the \\n perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little \\n hand. Oh, oh, oh! \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged. \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the \\n dignity of the whole body. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Well, well, well,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n Pray God it be, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known \\n those which have walked in their sleep who have died \\n holily in their beds. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so \\n pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he \\n cannot come out on's grave. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Even so? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MACBETH \\n To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate: \\n come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's \\n done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Will she go now to bed? \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n Directly. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds \\n Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds \\n To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets: \\n More needs she the divine than the physician. \\n God, God forgive us all! Look after her; \\n Remove from her the means of all annoyance, \\n And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night: \\n My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight. \\n I think, but dare not speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentlewoman \\n Good night, good doctor. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  The country near Dunsinane. \\n Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS,\\nLENNOX, and Soldiers \\n\\n \\n MENTEITH \\n The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, \\n His uncle Siward and the good Macduff: \\n Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes \\n Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm \\n Excite the mortified man. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANGUS \\n Near Birnam wood \\n Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAITHNESS \\n Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother? \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file \\n Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son, \\n And many unrough youths that even now \\n Protest their first of manhood. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENTEITH \\n What does the tyrant? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAITHNESS \\n Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies: \\n Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him \\n Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain, \\n He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause \\n Within the belt of rule. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANGUS \\n Now does he feel \\n His secret murders sticking on his hands; \\n Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach; \\n Those he commands move only in command, \\n Nothing in love: now does he feel his title \\n Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe \\n Upon a dwarfish thief. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENTEITH \\n Who then shall blame \\n His pester'd senses to recoil and start, \\n When all that is within him does condemn \\n Itself for being there? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAITHNESS \\n Well, march we on, \\n To give obedience where 'tis truly owed: \\n Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, \\n And with him pour we in our country's purge \\n Each drop of us. \\n \\n\\n \\n LENNOX \\n Or so much as it needs, \\n To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds. \\n Make we our march towards Birnam. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt, marching \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Dunsinane. A room in the castle. \\n Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Bring me no more reports; let them fly all: \\n Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane, \\n I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm? \\n Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know \\n All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: \\n 'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman \\n Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly, \\n false thanes, \\n And mingle with the English epicures: \\n The mind I sway by and the heart I bear \\n Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear. \\n Enter a Servant \\n The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon! \\n Where got'st thou that goose look? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n There is ten thousand-- \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Geese, villain! \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Soldiers, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, \\n Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch? \\n Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine \\n Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n The English force, so please you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Take thy face hence. \\n Exit Servant \\n Seyton!--I am sick at heart, \\n When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push \\n Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now. \\n I have lived long enough: my way of life \\n Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf; \\n And that which should accompany old age, \\n As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, \\n I must not look to have; but, in their stead, \\n Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath, \\n Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter SEYTON \\n\\n \\n SEYTON \\n What is your gracious pleasure? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n What news more? \\n \\n\\n \\n SEYTON \\n All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd. \\n Give me my armour. \\n \\n\\n \\n SEYTON \\n 'Tis not needed yet. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I'll put it on. \\n Send out more horses; skirr the country round; \\n Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour. \\n How does your patient, doctor? \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Not so sick, my lord, \\n As she is troubled with thick coming fancies, \\n That keep her from her rest. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Cure her of that. \\n Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, \\n Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, \\n Raze out the written troubles of the brain \\n And with some sweet oblivious antidote \\n Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff \\n Which weighs upon the heart? \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Therein the patient \\n Must minister to himself. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it. \\n Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff. \\n Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me. \\n Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast \\n The water of my land, find her disease, \\n And purge it to a sound and pristine health, \\n I would applaud thee to the very echo, \\n That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.-- \\n What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug, \\n Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them? \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation \\n Makes us hear something. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Bring it after me. \\n I will not be afraid of death and bane, \\n Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane. \\n \\n\\n \\n Doctor \\n Aside   Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, \\n Profit again should hardly draw me here. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Country near Birnam wood. \\n Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG\\nSIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS,\\nLENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand \\n That chambers will be safe. \\n \\n\\n \\n MENTEITH \\n We doubt it nothing. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n What wood is this before us? \\n \\n\\n \\n MENTEITH \\n The wood of Birnam. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Let every soldier hew him down a bough \\n And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow \\n The numbers of our host and make discovery \\n Err in report of us. \\n \\n\\n \\n Soldiers \\n It shall be done. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n We learn no other but the confident tyrant \\n Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure \\n Our setting down before 't. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n 'Tis his main hope: \\n For where there is advantage to be given, \\n Both more and less have given him the revolt, \\n And none serve with him but constrained things \\n Whose hearts are absent too. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Let our just censures \\n Attend the true event, and put we on \\n Industrious soldiership. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n The time approaches \\n That will with due decision make us know \\n What we shall say we have and what we owe. \\n Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, \\n But certain issue strokes must arbitrate: \\n Towards which advance the war. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt, marching \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Dunsinane. Within the castle. \\n Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum\\nand colours \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Hang out our banners on the outward walls; \\n The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength \\n Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie \\n Till famine and the ague eat them up: \\n Were they not forced with those that should be ours, \\n We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, \\n And beat them backward home. \\n A cry of women within \\n What is that noise? \\n \\n\\n \\n SEYTON \\n It is the cry of women, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I have almost forgot the taste of fears; \\n The time has been, my senses would have cool'd \\n To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair \\n Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir \\n As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors; \\n Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts \\n Cannot once start me. \\n Re-enter SEYTON \\n Wherefore was that cry? \\n \\n\\n \\n SEYTON \\n The queen, my lord, is dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n She should have died hereafter; \\n There would have been a time for such a word. \\n To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, \\n Creeps in this petty pace from day to day \\n To the last syllable of recorded time, \\n And all our yesterdays have lighted fools \\n The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! \\n Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player \\n That struts and frets his hour upon the stage \\n And then is heard no more: it is a tale \\n Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, \\n Signifying nothing. \\n Enter a Messenger \\n Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Gracious my lord, \\n I should report that which I say I saw, \\n But know not how to do it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Well, say, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n As I did stand my watch upon the hill, \\n I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought, \\n The wood began to move. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Liar and slave! \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so: \\n Within this three mile may you see it coming; \\n I say, a moving grove. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n If thou speak'st false, \\n Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, \\n Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth, \\n I care not if thou dost for me as much. \\n I pull in resolution, and begin \\n To doubt the equivocation of the fiend \\n That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood \\n Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood \\n Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out! \\n If this which he avouches does appear, \\n There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here. \\n I gin to be aweary of the sun, \\n And wish the estate o' the world were now undone. \\n Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack! \\n At least we'll die with harness on our back. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Dunsinane. Before the castle. \\n Drum and colours.

You, worthy uncle, \\n Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son, \\n Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we \\n Shall take upon 's what else remains to do, \\n According to our order. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n Fare you well. \\n Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night, \\n Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, \\n Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VII.  Another part of the field. \\n Alarums. Enter MACBETH \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly, \\n But, bear-like, I must fight the course.

Such a one \\n Am I to fear, or none. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter YOUNG SIWARD \\n\\n \\n YOUNG SIWARD \\n What is thy name? \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Thou'lt be afraid to hear it. \\n \\n\\n \\n YOUNG SIWARD \\n No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name \\n Than any is in hell. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n My name's Macbeth. \\n \\n\\n \\n YOUNG SIWARD \\n The devil himself could not pronounce a title \\n More hateful to mine ear. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n No, nor more fearful. \\n \\n\\n \\n YOUNG SIWARD \\n Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword \\n I'll prove the lie thou speak'st. \\n \\n\\n\\n They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n Thou wast born of woman \\n But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, \\n Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Alarums. Enter MACDUFF \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face! \\n If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine, \\n My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still. \\n I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms \\n Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth, \\n Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge \\n I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be; \\n By this great clatter, one of greatest note \\n Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune! \\n And more I beg not. \\n \\n\\n Exit. Alarums \\n Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd: \\n The tyrant's people on both sides do fight; \\n The noble thanes do bravely in the war; \\n The day almost itself professes yours, \\n And little is to do. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n We have met with foes \\n That strike beside us. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n Enter, sir, the castle. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt.

I'll not fight with thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Then yield thee, coward, \\n And live to be the show and gaze o' the time: \\n We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, \\n Painted on a pole, and underwrit, \\n 'Here may you see the tyrant.' \\n \\n\\n \\n MACBETH \\n I will not yield, \\n To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet, \\n And to be baited with the rabble's curse. \\n Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, \\n And thou opposed, being of no woman born, \\n Yet I will try the last. Before my body \\n I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff, \\n And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!' \\n \\n\\n Exeunt, fighting. Alarums \\n Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours,\\nMALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n I would the friends we miss were safe arrived. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n Some must go off: and yet, by these I see, \\n So great a day as this is cheaply bought. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n Macduff is missing, and your noble son. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt: \\n He only lived but till he was a man; \\n The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd \\n In the unshrinking station where he fought, \\n But like a man he died. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n Then he is dead? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow \\n Must not be measured by his worth, for then \\n It hath no end. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n Had he his hurts before? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROSS \\n Ay, on the front. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n Why then, God's soldier be he! \\n Had I as many sons as I have hairs, \\n I would not wish them to a fairer death: \\n And so, his knell is knoll'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n He's worth more sorrow, \\n And that I'll spend for him. \\n \\n\\n \\n SIWARD \\n He's worth no more \\n They say he parted well, and paid his score: \\n And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head \\n\\n \\n MACDUFF \\n Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands \\n The usurper's cursed head: the time is free: \\n I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl, \\n That speak my salutation in their minds; \\n Whose voices I desire aloud with mine: \\n Hail, King of Scotland! \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Hail, King of Scotland! \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish \\n\\n \\n MALCOLM \\n We shall not spend a large expense of time \\n Before we reckon with your several loves, \\n And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen, \\n Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland \\n In such an honour named. What's more to do, \\n Which would be planted newly with the time, \\n As calling home our exiled friends abroad \\n That fled the snares of watchful tyranny; \\n Producing forth the cruel ministers \\n Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, \\n Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands \\n Took off her life; this, and what needful else \\n That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, \\n We will perform in measure, time and place: \\n So, thanks to all at once and to each one, \\n Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish.

Venice. A street. \\n Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n In sooth, I know not why I am so sad: \\n It wearies me; you say it wearies you; \\n But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, \\n What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born, \\n I am to learn; \\n And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, \\n That I have much ado to know myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Your mind is tossing on the ocean; \\n There, where your argosies with portly sail, \\n Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, \\n Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea, \\n Do overpeer the petty traffickers, \\n That curtsy to them, do them reverence, \\n As they fly by them with their woven wings. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, \\n The better part of my affections would \\n Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still \\n Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind, \\n Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads; \\n And every object that might make me fear \\n Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt \\n Would make me sad. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n My wind cooling my broth \\n Would blow me to an ague, when I thought \\n What harm a wind too great at sea might do. \\n I should not see the sandy hour-glass run, \\n But I should think of shallows and of flats, \\n And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand, \\n Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs \\n To kiss her burial. Should I go to church \\n And see the holy edifice of stone, \\n And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, \\n Which touching but my gentle vessel's side, \\n Would scatter all her spices on the stream, \\n Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, \\n And, in a word, but even now worth this, \\n And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought \\n To think on this, and shall I lack the thought \\n That such a thing bechanced would make me sad? \\n But tell not me; I know, Antonio \\n Is sad to think upon his merchandise. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it, \\n My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, \\n Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate \\n Upon the fortune of this present year: \\n Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Why, then you are in love. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Fie, fie! \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad, \\n Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy \\n For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry, \\n Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, \\n Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time: \\n Some that will evermore peep through their eyes \\n And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper, \\n And other of such vinegar aspect \\n That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile, \\n Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, \\n Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well: \\n We leave you now with better company. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n I would have stay'd till I had made you merry, \\n If worthier friends had not prevented me. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Your worth is very dear in my regard. \\n I take it, your own business calls on you \\n And you embrace the occasion to depart. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Good morrow, my good lords. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when? \\n You grow exceeding strange: must it be so? \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n We'll make our leisures to attend on yours. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Salarino and Salanio \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, \\n We two will leave you: but at dinner-time, \\n I pray you, have in mind where we must meet. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n I will not fail you. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n You look not well, Signior Antonio; \\n You have too much respect upon the world: \\n They lose it that do buy it with much care: \\n Believe me, you are marvellously changed. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano; \\n A stage where every man must play a part, \\n And mine a sad one. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Let me play the fool: \\n With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, \\n And let my liver rather heat with wine \\n Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. \\n Why should a man, whose blood is warm within, \\n Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? \\n Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice \\n By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio-- \\n I love thee, and it is my love that speaks-- \\n There are a sort of men whose visages \\n Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, \\n And do a wilful stillness entertain, \\n With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion \\n Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, \\n As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle, \\n And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!' \\n O my Antonio, I do know of these \\n That therefore only are reputed wise \\n For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, \\n If they should speak, would almost damn those ears, \\n Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools. \\n I'll tell thee more of this another time: \\n But fish not, with this melancholy bait, \\n For this fool gudgeon, this opinion. \\n Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile: \\n I'll end my exhortation after dinner. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time: \\n I must be one of these same dumb wise men, \\n For Gratiano never lets me speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Well, keep me company but two years moe, \\n Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable \\n In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Is that any thing now? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more \\n than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two \\n grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you \\n shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you \\n have them, they are not worth the search. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Well, tell me now what lady is the same \\n To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, \\n That you to-day promised to tell me of? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, \\n How much I have disabled mine estate, \\n By something showing a more swelling port \\n Than my faint means would grant continuance: \\n Nor do I now make moan to be abridged \\n From such a noble rate; but my chief care \\n Is to come fairly off from the great debts \\n Wherein my time something too prodigal \\n Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio, \\n I owe the most, in money and in love, \\n And from your love I have a warranty \\n To unburden all my plots and purposes \\n How to get clear of all the debts I owe. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; \\n And if it stand, as you yourself still do, \\n Within the eye of honour, be assured, \\n My purse, my person, my extremest means, \\n Lie all unlock'd to your occasions. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, \\n I shot his fellow of the self-same flight \\n The self-same way with more advised watch, \\n To find the other forth, and by adventuring both \\n I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof, \\n Because what follows is pure innocence. \\n I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, \\n That which I owe is lost; but if you please \\n To shoot another arrow that self way \\n Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, \\n As I will watch the aim, or to find both \\n Or bring your latter hazard back again \\n And thankfully rest debtor for the first. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n You know me well, and herein spend but time \\n To wind about my love with circumstance; \\n And out of doubt you do me now more wrong \\n In making question of my uttermost \\n Than if you had made waste of all I have: \\n Then do but say to me what I should do \\n That in your knowledge may by me be done, \\n And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n In Belmont is a lady richly left; \\n And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, \\n Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes \\n I did receive fair speechless messages: \\n Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued \\n To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia: \\n Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, \\n For the four winds blow in from every coast \\n Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks \\n Hang on her temples like a golden fleece; \\n Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand, \\n And many Jasons come in quest of her. \\n O my Antonio, had I but the means \\n To hold a rival place with one of them, \\n I have a mind presages me such thrift, \\n That I should questionless be fortunate! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea; \\n Neither have I money nor commodity \\n To raise a present sum: therefore go forth; \\n Try what my credit can in Venice do: \\n That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost, \\n To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia. \\n Go, presently inquire, and so will I, \\n Where money is, and I no question make \\n To have it of my trust or for my sake. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house. \\n Enter PORTIA and NERISSA \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of \\n this great world. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in \\n the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and \\n yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit \\n with too much as they that starve with nothing. It \\n is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the \\n mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but \\n competency lives longer. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Good sentences and well pronounced. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n They would be better, if well followed. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n If to do were as easy as to know what were good to \\n do, chapels had been churches and poor men's \\n cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that \\n follows his own instructions: I can easier teach \\n twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the \\n twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may \\n devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps \\n o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the \\n youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the \\n cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to \\n choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may \\n neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I \\n dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed \\n by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, \\n Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none? \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their \\n death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery, \\n that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, \\n silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning \\n chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any \\n rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what \\n warmth is there in your affection towards any of \\n these princely suitors that are already come? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest \\n them, I will describe them; and, according to my \\n description, level at my affection. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n First, there is the Neapolitan prince. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but \\n talk of his horse; and he makes it a great \\n appropriation to his own good parts, that he can \\n shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his \\n mother played false with a smith. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Then there is the County Palatine. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you \\n will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and \\n smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping \\n philosopher when he grows old, being so full of \\n unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be \\n married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth \\n than to either of these. God defend me from these \\n two! \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. \\n In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but, \\n he! why, he hath a horse better than the \\n Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than \\n the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a \\n throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will \\n fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I \\n should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me \\n I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I \\n shall never requite him. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron \\n of England? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n You know I say nothing to him, for he understands \\n not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, \\n nor Italian, and you will come into the court and \\n swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. \\n He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can \\n converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! \\n I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round \\n hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his \\n behavior every where. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he \\n borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and \\n swore he would pay him again when he was able: I \\n think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed \\n under for another. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and \\n most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when \\n he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and \\n when he is worst, he is little better than a beast: \\n and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall \\n make shift to go without him. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n If he should offer to choose, and choose the right \\n casket, you should refuse to perform your father's \\n will, if you should refuse to accept him. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a \\n deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket, \\n for if the devil be within and that temptation \\n without, I know he will choose it. I will do any \\n thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n You need not fear, lady, the having any of these \\n lords: they have acquainted me with their \\n determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their \\n home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless \\n you may be won by some other sort than your father's \\n imposition depending on the caskets. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as \\n chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner \\n of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers \\n are so reasonable, for there is not one among them \\n but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant \\n them a fair departure. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a \\n Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither \\n in company of the Marquis of Montferrat? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish \\n eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of \\n thy praise. \\n Enter a Serving-man \\n How now! what news? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take \\n their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a \\n fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the \\n prince his master will be here to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a \\n heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should \\n be glad of his approach: if he have the condition \\n of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had \\n rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, \\n Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. \\n Whiles we shut the gates \\n upon one wooer, another knocks at the door. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Venice. A public place. \\n Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Three thousand ducats; well. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Ay, sir, for three months. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n For three months; well. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Antonio shall become bound; well. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I \\n know your answer? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Your answer to that. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Antonio is a good man. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Have you heard any imputation to the contrary? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a \\n good man is to have you understand me that he is \\n sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he \\n hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the \\n Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he \\n hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and \\n other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships \\n are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats \\n and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I \\n mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, \\n winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, \\n sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may \\n take his bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Be assured you may. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured, \\n I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n If it please you to dine with us. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which \\n your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I \\n will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, \\n walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat \\n with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What \\n news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ANTONIO \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n This is Signior Antonio. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Aside   How like a fawning publican he looks! \\n I hate him for he is a Christian, \\n But more for that in low simplicity \\n He lends out money gratis and brings down \\n The rate of usance here with us in Venice. \\n If I can catch him once upon the hip, \\n I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. \\n He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, \\n Even there where merchants most do congregate, \\n On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift, \\n Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe, \\n If I forgive him! \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Shylock, do you hear? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I am debating of my present store, \\n And, by the near guess of my memory, \\n I cannot instantly raise up the gross \\n Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? \\n Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, \\n Will furnish me. But soft! how many months \\n Do you desire? \\n To ANTONIO \\n Rest you fair, good signior; \\n Your worship was the last man in our mouths. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow \\n By taking nor by giving of excess, \\n Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend, \\n I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd \\n How much ye would? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n And for three months. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I had forgot; three months; you told me so. \\n Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you; \\n Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow \\n Upon advantage. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I do never use it. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep-- \\n This Jacob from our holy Abram was, \\n As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, \\n The third possessor; ay, he was the third-- \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n And what of him? did he take interest? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n No, not take interest, not, as you would say, \\n Directly interest: mark what Jacob did. \\n When Laban and himself were compromised \\n That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied \\n Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank, \\n In the end of autumn turned to the rams, \\n And, when the work of generation was \\n Between these woolly breeders in the act, \\n The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands, \\n And, in the doing of the deed of kind, \\n He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, \\n Who then conceiving did in eaning time \\n Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's. \\n This was a way to thrive, and he was blest: \\n And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for; \\n A thing not in his power to bring to pass, \\n But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven. \\n Was this inserted to make interest good? \\n Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast: \\n But note me, signior. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Mark you this, Bassanio, \\n The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. \\n An evil soul producing holy witness \\n Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, \\n A goodly apple rotten at the heart: \\n O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath! \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum. \\n Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate-- \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Signior Antonio, many a time and oft \\n In the Rialto you have rated me \\n About my moneys and my usances: \\n Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, \\n For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe. \\n You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, \\n And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine, \\n And all for use of that which is mine own. \\n Well then, it now appears you need my help: \\n Go to, then; you come to me, and you say \\n 'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so; \\n You, that did void your rheum upon my beard \\n And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur \\n Over your threshold: moneys is your suit \\n What should I say to you? Should I not say \\n 'Hath a dog money? is it possible \\n A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or \\n Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key, \\n With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this; \\n 'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last; \\n You spurn'd me such a day; another time \\n You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies \\n I'll lend you thus much moneys'? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I am as like to call thee so again, \\n To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too. \\n If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not \\n As to thy friends; for when did friendship take \\n A breed for barren metal of his friend? \\n But lend it rather to thine enemy, \\n Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face \\n Exact the penalty. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Why, look you, how you storm! \\n I would be friends with you and have your love, \\n Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with, \\n Supply your present wants and take no doit \\n Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me: \\n This is kind I offer. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n This were kindness. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n This kindness will I show. \\n Go with me to a notary, seal me there \\n Your single bond; and, in a merry sport, \\n If you repay me not on such a day, \\n In such a place, such sum or sums as are \\n Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit \\n Be nominated for an equal pound \\n Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken \\n In what part of your body pleaseth me. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond \\n And say there is much kindness in the Jew. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n You shall not seal to such a bond for me: \\n I'll rather dwell in my necessity. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it: \\n Within these two months, that's a month before \\n This bond expires, I do expect return \\n Of thrice three times the value of this bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n O father Abram, what these Christians are, \\n Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect \\n The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this; \\n If he should break his day, what should I gain \\n By the exaction of the forfeiture? \\n A pound of man's flesh taken from a man \\n Is not so estimable, profitable neither, \\n As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, \\n To buy his favour, I extend this friendship: \\n If he will take it, so; if not, adieu; \\n And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Then meet me forthwith at the notary's; \\n Give him direction for this merry bond, \\n And I will go and purse the ducats straight, \\n See to my house, left in the fearful guard \\n Of an unthrifty knave, and presently \\n I will be with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Hie thee, gentle Jew. \\n Exit Shylock \\n The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n I like not fair terms and a villain's mind. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Come on: in this there can be no dismay; \\n My ships come home a month before the day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT II \\n\\n SCENE I.  Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house. \\n Flourish of cornets.

By this scimitar \\n That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince \\n That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, \\n I would outstare the sternest eyes that look, \\n Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, \\n Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, \\n Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, \\n To win thee, lady. But, alas the while! \\n If Hercules and Lichas play at dice \\n Which is the better man, the greater throw \\n May turn by fortune from the weaker hand: \\n So is Alcides beaten by his page; \\n And so may I, blind fortune leading me, \\n Miss that which one unworthier may attain, \\n And die with grieving. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n You must take your chance, \\n And either not attempt to choose at all \\n Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong \\n Never to speak to lady afterward \\n In way of marriage: therefore be advised. \\n \\n\\n \\n MOROCCO \\n Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n First, forward to the temple: after dinner \\n Your hazard shall be made. \\n \\n\\n \\n MOROCCO \\n Good fortune then! \\n To make me blest or cursed'st among men. \\n \\n\\n\\n Cornets, and exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Venice. A street. \\n Enter LAUNCELOT \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from \\n this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and \\n tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good \\n Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot \\n Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My \\n conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot; \\n take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest \\n Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy \\n heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me \\n pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the \\n fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,' \\n says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience, \\n hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely \\n to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest \\n man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for, \\n indeed, my father did something smack, something \\n grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience \\n says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the \\n fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience. \\n 'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,' \\n say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my \\n conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, \\n who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to \\n run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the \\n fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil \\n himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil \\n incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is \\n but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel \\n me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more \\n friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are \\n at your command; I will run. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way \\n to master Jew's? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Aside   O heavens, this is my true-begotten father! \\n who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, \\n knows me not: I will try confusions with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way \\n to master Jew's? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, \\n at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at \\n the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn \\n down indirectly to the Jew's house. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can \\n you tell me whether one Launcelot, \\n that dwells with him, dwell with him or no? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Talk you of young Master Launcelot? \\n Aside \\n Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you \\n of young Master Launcelot? \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father, \\n though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man \\n and, God be thanked, well to live. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of \\n young Master Launcelot. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, \\n talk you of young Master Launcelot? \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master \\n Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman, \\n according to Fates and Destinies and such odd \\n sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of \\n learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say \\n in plain terms, gone to heaven. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my \\n age, my very prop. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or \\n a prop? Do you know me, father? \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman: \\n but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his \\n soul, alive or dead? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Do you not know me, father? \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of \\n the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his \\n own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of \\n your son: give me your blessing: truth will come \\n to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son \\n may, but at the length truth will out. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not \\n Launcelot, my boy. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but \\n give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy \\n that was, your son that is, your child that shall \\n be. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n I cannot think you are my son. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n I know not what I shall think of that: but I am \\n Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your \\n wife is my mother. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou \\n be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. \\n Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou \\n got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than \\n Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows \\n backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail \\n than I have of my face when I last saw him. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy \\n master agree? I have brought him a present. How \\n 'gree you now? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set \\n up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I \\n have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give \\n him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in \\n his service; you may tell every finger I have with \\n my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me \\n your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed, \\n gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I \\n will run as far as God has any ground. O rare \\n fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I \\n am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper \\n be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See \\n these letters delivered; put the liveries to making, \\n and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit a Servant \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n To him, father. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n God bless your worship! \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me? \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that \\n would, sir, as my father shall specify-- \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, \\n and have a desire, as my father shall specify-- \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, \\n are scarce cater-cousins-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having \\n done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I \\n hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you-- \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon \\n your worship, and my suit is-- \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as \\n your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, \\n though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n One speak for both. What would you? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Serve you, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n GOBBO \\n That is the very defect of the matter, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit: \\n Shylock thy master spoke with me this day, \\n And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment \\n To leave a rich Jew's service, to become \\n The follower of so poor a gentleman. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n The old proverb is very well parted between my \\n master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of \\n God, sir, and he hath enough. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son. \\n Take leave of thy old master and inquire \\n My lodging out. Give him a livery \\n More guarded than his fellows': see it done. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have \\n ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in \\n Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear \\n upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to, \\n here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle \\n of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven \\n widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one \\n man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be \\n in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; \\n here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a \\n woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father, \\n come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this: \\n These things being bought and orderly bestow'd, \\n Return in haste, for I do feast to-night \\n My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go. \\n \\n\\n \\n LEONARDO \\n My best endeavours shall be done herein. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter GRATIANO \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Where is your master? \\n \\n\\n \\n LEONARDO \\n Yonder, sir, he walks. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Signior Bassanio! \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Gratiano! \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n I have a suit to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n You have obtain'd it. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano; \\n Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice; \\n Parts that become thee happily enough \\n And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; \\n But where thou art not known, why, there they show \\n Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain \\n To allay with some cold drops of modesty \\n Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior \\n I be misconstrued in the place I go to, \\n And lose my hopes. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Signior Bassanio, hear me: \\n If I do not put on a sober habit, \\n Talk with respect and swear but now and then, \\n Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, \\n Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes \\n Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,' \\n Use all the observance of civility, \\n Like one well studied in a sad ostent \\n To please his grandam, never trust me more. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Well, we shall see your bearing. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me \\n By what we do to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n No, that were pity: \\n I would entreat you rather to put on \\n Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends \\n That purpose merriment. But fare you well: \\n I have some business. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n And I must to Lorenzo and the rest: \\n But we will visit you at supper-time. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.

Most beautiful \\n pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play \\n the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, \\n adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my \\n manly spirit: adieu. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Farewell, good Launcelot. \\n Exit Launcelot \\n Alack, what heinous sin is it in me \\n To be ashamed to be my father's child! \\n But though I am a daughter to his blood, \\n I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo, \\n If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, \\n Become a Christian and thy loving wife. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  The same.

Before SHYLOCK'S house. \\n Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, \\n The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:-- \\n What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise, \\n As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!-- \\n And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;-- \\n Why, Jessica, I say! \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Why, Jessica! \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Your worship was wont to tell me that \\n I could do nothing without bidding. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Jessica \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Call you? what is your will? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I am bid forth to supper, Jessica: \\n There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? \\n I am not bid for love; they flatter me: \\n But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon \\n The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl, \\n Look to my house. I am right loath to go: \\n There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, \\n For I did dream of money-bags to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect \\n your reproach. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n So do I his. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n An they have conspired together, I will not say you \\n shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not \\n for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on \\n Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning, \\n falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four \\n year, in the afternoon. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica: \\n Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum \\n And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife, \\n Clamber not you up to the casements then, \\n Nor thrust your head into the public street \\n To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces, \\n But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements: \\n Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter \\n My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear, \\n I have no mind of feasting forth to-night: \\n But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah; \\n Say I will come. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n I will go before, sir.

Well, Jessica, go in; \\n Perhaps I will return immediately: \\n Do as I bid you; shut doors after you: \\n Fast bind, fast find; \\n A proverb never stale in thrifty mind. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost, \\n I have a father, you a daughter, lost. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  The same. \\n Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo \\n Desired us to make stand. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n His hour is almost past. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour, \\n For lovers ever run before the clock. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly \\n To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont \\n To keep obliged faith unforfeited! \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n That ever holds: who riseth from a feast \\n With that keen appetite that he sits down? \\n Where is the horse that doth untread again \\n His tedious measures with the unbated fire \\n That he did pace them first? All things that are, \\n Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd. \\n How like a younker or a prodigal \\n The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, \\n Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind! \\n How like the prodigal doth she return, \\n With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails, \\n Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind! \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LORENZO \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode; \\n Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait: \\n When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, \\n I'll watch as long for you then. Approach; \\n Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty, \\n Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Lorenzo, and thy love. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed, \\n For who love I so much? And now who knows \\n But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains. \\n I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me, \\n For I am much ashamed of my exchange: \\n But love is blind and lovers cannot see \\n The pretty follies that themselves commit; \\n For if they could, Cupid himself would blush \\n To see me thus transformed to a boy. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Descend, for you must be my torchbearer. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n What, must I hold a candle to my shames? \\n They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light. \\n Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love; \\n And I should be obscured. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n So are you, sweet, \\n Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. \\n But come at once; \\n For the close night doth play the runaway, \\n And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n I will make fast the doors, and gild myself \\n With some more ducats, and be with you straight. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit above \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Beshrew me but I love her heartily; \\n For she is wise, if I can judge of her, \\n And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, \\n And true she is, as she hath proved herself, \\n And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true, \\n Shall she be placed in my constant soul. \\n Enter JESSICA, below \\n What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away! \\n Our masquing mates by this time for us stay. \\n \\n\\n Exit with Jessica and Salarino \\n Enter ANTONIO \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Who's there? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Signior Antonio! \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest? \\n 'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you. \\n No masque to-night: the wind is come about; \\n Bassanio presently will go aboard: \\n I have sent twenty out to seek for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n I am glad on't: I desire no more delight \\n Than to be under sail and gone to-night. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VII.  Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house. \\n Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the\\nPRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Go draw aside the curtains and discover \\n The several caskets to this noble prince. \\n Now make your choice. \\n \\n\\n \\n MOROCCO \\n The first, of gold, who this inscription bears, \\n 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;' \\n The second, silver, which this promise carries, \\n 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;' \\n This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt, \\n 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.' \\n How shall I know if I do choose the right? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n The one of them contains my picture, prince: \\n If you choose that, then I am yours withal. \\n \\n\\n \\n MOROCCO \\n Some god direct my judgment! Let me see; \\n I will survey the inscriptions back again. \\n What says this leaden casket? \\n 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.' \\n Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead? \\n This casket threatens. Men that hazard all \\n Do it in hope of fair advantages: \\n A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross; \\n I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. \\n What says the silver with her virgin hue? \\n 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.' \\n As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, \\n And weigh thy value with an even hand: \\n If thou be'st rated by thy estimation, \\n Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough \\n May not extend so far as to the lady: \\n And yet to be afeard of my deserving \\n Were but a weak disabling of myself. \\n As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady: \\n I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, \\n In graces and in qualities of breeding; \\n But more than these, in love I do deserve. \\n What if I stray'd no further, but chose here? \\n Let's see once more this saying graved in gold \\n 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.' \\n Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her; \\n From the four corners of the earth they come, \\n To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint: \\n The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds \\n Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now \\n For princes to come view fair Portia: \\n The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head \\n Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar \\n To stop the foreign spirits, but they come, \\n As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia. \\n One of these three contains her heavenly picture. \\n Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation \\n To think so base a thought: it were too gross \\n To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave. \\n Or shall I think in silver she's immured, \\n Being ten times undervalued to tried gold? \\n O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem \\n Was set in worse than gold. They have in England \\n A coin that bears the figure of an angel \\n Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon; \\n But here an angel in a golden bed \\n Lies all within. Deliver me the key: \\n Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there, \\n Then I am yours. \\n \\n\\n\\n He unlocks the golden casket \\n\\n \\n MOROCCO \\n O hell! what have we here? \\n A carrion Death, within whose empty eye \\n There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing. \\n Reads \\n All that glitters is not gold; \\n Often have you heard that told: \\n Many a man his life hath sold \\n But my outside to behold: \\n Gilded tombs do worms enfold. \\n Had you been as wise as bold, \\n Young in limbs, in judgment old, \\n Your answer had not been inscroll'd: \\n Fare you well; your suit is cold. \\n Cold, indeed; and labour lost: \\n Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost! \\n Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart \\n To take a tedious leave: thus losers part. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go. \\n Let all of his complexion choose me so. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VIII.  Venice. A street. \\n Enter SALARINO and SALANIO \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail: \\n With him is Gratiano gone along; \\n And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke, \\n Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n He came too late, the ship was under sail: \\n But there the duke was given to understand \\n That in a gondola were seen together \\n Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica: \\n Besides, Antonio certified the duke \\n They were not with Bassanio in his ship. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n I never heard a passion so confused, \\n So strange, outrageous, and so variable, \\n As the dog Jew did utter in the streets: \\n 'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! \\n Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! \\n Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter! \\n A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, \\n Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter! \\n And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones, \\n Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl; \\n She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.' \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, \\n Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Let good Antonio look he keep his day, \\n Or he shall pay for this. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Marry, well remember'd. \\n I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday, \\n Who told me, in the narrow seas that part \\n The French and English, there miscarried \\n A vessel of our country richly fraught: \\n I thought upon Antonio when he told me; \\n And wish'd in silence that it were not his. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n You were best to tell Antonio what you hear; \\n Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n A kinder gentleman treads not the earth. \\n I saw Bassanio and Antonio part: \\n Bassanio told him he would make some speed \\n Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so; \\n Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio \\n But stay the very riping of the time; \\n And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me, \\n Let it not enter in your mind of love: \\n Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts \\n To courtship and such fair ostents of love \\n As shall conveniently become you there:' \\n And even there, his eye being big with tears, \\n Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, \\n And with affection wondrous sensible \\n He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n I think he only loves the world for him. \\n I pray thee, let us go and find him out \\n And quicken his embraced heaviness \\n With some delight or other. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Do we so. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IX.  Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house. \\n Enter NERISSA with a Servitor \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight: \\n The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath, \\n And comes to his election presently. \\n \\n\\n\\n Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,\\nPORTIA, and their trains \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince: \\n If you choose that wherein I am contain'd, \\n Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized: \\n But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, \\n You must be gone from hence immediately. \\n \\n\\n \\n ARRAGON \\n I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things: \\n First, never to unfold to any one \\n Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail \\n Of the right casket, never in my life \\n To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly, \\n If I do fail in fortune of my choice, \\n Immediately to leave you and be gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n To these injunctions every one doth swear \\n That comes to hazard for my worthless self. \\n \\n\\n \\n ARRAGON \\n And so have I address'd me. Fortune now \\n To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead. \\n 'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.' \\n You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard. \\n What says the golden chest? ha! let me see: \\n 'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.' \\n What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant \\n By the fool multitude, that choose by show, \\n Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach; \\n Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet, \\n Builds in the weather on the outward wall, \\n Even in the force and road of casualty. \\n I will not choose what many men desire, \\n Because I will not jump with common spirits \\n And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. \\n Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house; \\n Tell me once more what title thou dost bear: \\n 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:' \\n And well said too; for who shall go about \\n To cozen fortune and be honourable \\n Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume \\n To wear an undeserved dignity. \\n O, that estates, degrees and offices \\n Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour \\n Were purchased by the merit of the wearer! \\n How many then should cover that stand bare! \\n How many be commanded that command! \\n How much low peasantry would then be glean'd \\n From the true seed of honour! and how much honour \\n Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times \\n To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice: \\n 'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.' \\n I will assume desert. Give me a key for this, \\n And instantly unlock my fortunes here. \\n \\n\\n\\n He opens the silver casket \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Too long a pause for that which you find there. \\n \\n\\n \\n ARRAGON \\n What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot, \\n Presenting me a schedule! I will read it. \\n How much unlike art thou to Portia! \\n How much unlike my hopes and my deservings! \\n 'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.' \\n Did I deserve no more than a fool's head? \\n Is that my prize? are my deserts no better? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n To offend, and judge, are distinct offices \\n And of opposed natures. \\n \\n\\n \\n ARRAGON \\n What is here? \\n Reads \\n The fire seven times tried this: \\n Seven times tried that judgment is, \\n That did never choose amiss. \\n Some there be that shadows kiss; \\n Such have but a shadow's bliss: \\n There be fools alive, I wis, \\n Silver'd o'er; and so was this. \\n Take what wife you will to bed, \\n I will ever be your head: \\n So be gone: you are sped. \\n Still more fool I shall appear \\n By the time I linger here \\n With one fool's head I came to woo, \\n But I go away with two. \\n Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath, \\n Patiently to bear my wroth. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Arragon and train \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Thus hath the candle singed the moth. \\n O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose, \\n They have the wisdom by their wit to lose. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n The ancient saying is no heresy, \\n Hanging and wiving goes by destiny. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Servant \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Where is my lady? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Here: what would my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Madam, there is alighted at your gate \\n A young Venetian, one that comes before \\n To signify the approaching of his lord; \\n From whom he bringeth sensible regreets, \\n To wit, besides commends and courteous breath, \\n Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen \\n So likely an ambassador of love: \\n A day in April never came so sweet, \\n To show how costly summer was at hand, \\n As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard \\n Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, \\n Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him. \\n Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see \\n Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.  Venice. A street. \\n Enter SALANIO and SALARINO \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Now, what news on the Rialto? \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath \\n a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas; \\n the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very \\n dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many \\n a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip \\n Report be an honest woman of her word. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever \\n knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she \\n wept for the death of a third husband. But it is \\n true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the \\n plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the \\n honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough \\n to keep his name company!-- \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Come, the full stop. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath \\n lost a ship. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n I would it might prove the end of his losses. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my \\n prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew. \\n Enter SHYLOCK \\n How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my \\n daughter's flight. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor \\n that made the wings she flew withal. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was \\n fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all \\n to leave the dam. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n She is damned for it. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n That's certain, if the devil may be her judge. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n My own flesh and blood to rebel! \\n \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n There is more difference between thy flesh and hers \\n than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods \\n than there is between red wine and rhenish. But \\n tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any \\n loss at sea or no? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a \\n prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the \\n Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon \\n the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to \\n call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was \\n wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him \\n look to his bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take \\n his flesh: what's that good for? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else, \\n it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and \\n hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses, \\n mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my \\n bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine \\n enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath \\n not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, \\n dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with \\n the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject \\n to the same diseases, healed by the same means, \\n warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as \\n a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? \\n if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison \\n us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not \\n revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will \\n resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, \\n what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian \\n wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by \\n Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you \\n teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I \\n will better the instruction. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Servant \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and \\n desires to speak with you both. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n We have been up and down to seek him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter TUBAL \\n\\n \\n SALANIO \\n Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be \\n matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou \\n found my daughter? \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone, \\n cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse \\n never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it \\n till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other \\n precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter \\n were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear! \\n would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in \\n her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know \\n not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon \\n loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to \\n find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge: \\n nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my \\n shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears \\n but of my shedding. \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I \\n heard in Genoa,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck? \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true? \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news! \\n ha, ha! where? in Genoa? \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one \\n night fourscore ducats. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my \\n gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting! \\n fourscore ducats! \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my \\n company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture \\n him: I am glad of it. \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n One of them showed me a ring that he had of your \\n daughter for a monkey. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my \\n turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: \\n I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. \\n \\n\\n \\n TUBAL \\n But Antonio is certainly undone. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee \\n me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I \\n will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were \\n he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I \\n will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; \\n go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house. \\n Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and\\nAttendants \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two \\n Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong, \\n I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile. \\n There's something tells me, but it is not love, \\n I would not lose you; and you know yourself, \\n Hate counsels not in such a quality. \\n But lest you should not understand me well,-- \\n And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,-- \\n I would detain you here some month or two \\n Before you venture for me. I could teach you \\n How to choose right, but I am then forsworn; \\n So will I never be: so may you miss me; \\n But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin, \\n That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes, \\n They have o'erlook'd me and divided me; \\n One half of me is yours, the other half yours, \\n Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, \\n And so all yours. O, these naughty times \\n Put bars between the owners and their rights! \\n And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so, \\n Let fortune go to hell for it, not I. \\n I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time, \\n To eke it and to draw it out in length, \\n To stay you from election. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Let me choose \\n For as I am, I live upon the rack. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess \\n What treason there is mingled with your love. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n None but that ugly treason of mistrust, \\n Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love: \\n There may as well be amity and life \\n 'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack, \\n Where men enforced do speak anything. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Well then, confess and live. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n 'Confess' and 'love' \\n Had been the very sum of my confession: \\n O happy torment, when my torturer \\n Doth teach me answers for deliverance! \\n But let me to my fortune and the caskets. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them: \\n If you do love me, you will find me out. \\n Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof. \\n Let music sound while he doth make his choice; \\n Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end, \\n Fading in music: that the comparison \\n May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream \\n And watery death-bed for him. He may win; \\n And what is music then? Then music is \\n Even as the flourish when true subjects bow \\n To a new-crowned monarch: such it is \\n As are those dulcet sounds in break of day \\n That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear, \\n And summon him to marriage. Now he goes, \\n With no less presence, but with much more love, \\n Than young Alcides, when he did redeem \\n The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy \\n To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice \\n The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, \\n With bleared visages, come forth to view \\n The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules! \\n Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay \\n I view the fight than thou that makest the fray. \\n Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself \\n SONG. \\n Tell me where is fancy bred, \\n Or in the heart, or in the head? \\n How begot, how nourished? \\n Reply, reply. \\n It is engender'd in the eyes, \\n With gazing fed; and fancy dies \\n In the cradle where it lies. \\n Let us all ring fancy's knell \\n I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell. \\n \\n\\n \\n ALL \\n Ding, dong, bell. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n So may the outward shows be least themselves: \\n The world is still deceived with ornament. \\n In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt, \\n But, being seasoned with a gracious voice, \\n Obscures the show of evil? In religion, \\n What damned error, but some sober brow \\n Will bless it and approve it with a text, \\n Hiding the grossness with fair ornament? \\n There is no vice so simple but assumes \\n Some mark of virtue on his outward parts: \\n How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false \\n As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins \\n The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars; \\n Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk; \\n And these assume but valour's excrement \\n To render them redoubted! Look on beauty, \\n And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight; \\n Which therein works a miracle in nature, \\n Making them lightest that wear most of it: \\n So are those crisped snaky golden locks \\n Which make such wanton gambols with the wind, \\n Upon supposed fairness, often known \\n To be the dowry of a second head, \\n The skull that bred them in the sepulchre. \\n Thus ornament is but the guiled shore \\n To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf \\n Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, \\n The seeming truth which cunning times put on \\n To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold, \\n Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee; \\n Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge \\n 'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead, \\n Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught, \\n Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence; \\n And here choose I; joy be the consequence! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Aside   How all the other passions fleet to air, \\n As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair, \\n And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love, \\n Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy, \\n In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess. \\n I feel too much thy blessing: make it less, \\n For fear I surfeit. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n What find I here? \\n Opening the leaden casket \\n Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god \\n Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes? \\n Or whether, riding on the balls of mine, \\n Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips, \\n Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar \\n Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs \\n The painter plays the spider and hath woven \\n A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men, \\n Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,-- \\n How could he see to do them? having made one, \\n Methinks it should have power to steal both his \\n And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far \\n The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow \\n In underprizing it, so far this shadow \\n Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll, \\n The continent and summary of my fortune. \\n Reads \\n You that choose not by the view, \\n Chance as fair and choose as true! \\n Since this fortune falls to you, \\n Be content and seek no new, \\n If you be well pleased with this \\n And hold your fortune for your bliss, \\n Turn you where your lady is \\n And claim her with a loving kiss. \\n A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave; \\n I come by note, to give and to receive. \\n Like one of two contending in a prize, \\n That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes, \\n Hearing applause and universal shout, \\n Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt \\n Whether these pearls of praise be his or no; \\n So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so; \\n As doubtful whether what I see be true, \\n Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand, \\n Such as I am: though for myself alone \\n I would not be ambitious in my wish, \\n To wish myself much better; yet, for you \\n I would be trebled twenty times myself; \\n A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich; \\n That only to stand high in your account, \\n I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends, \\n Exceed account; but the full sum of me \\n Is sum of something, which, to term in gross, \\n Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised; \\n Happy in this, she is not yet so old \\n But she may learn; happier than this, \\n She is not bred so dull but she can learn; \\n Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit \\n Commits itself to yours to be directed, \\n As from her lord, her governor, her king. \\n Myself and what is mine to you and yours \\n Is now converted: but now I was the lord \\n Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, \\n Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now, \\n This house, these servants and this same myself \\n Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring; \\n Which when you part from, lose, or give away, \\n Let it presage the ruin of your love \\n And be my vantage to exclaim on you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Madam, you have bereft me of all words, \\n Only my blood speaks to you in my veins; \\n And there is such confusion in my powers, \\n As after some oration fairly spoke \\n By a beloved prince, there doth appear \\n Among the buzzing pleased multitude; \\n Where every something, being blent together, \\n Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy, \\n Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring \\n Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence: \\n O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead! \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n My lord and lady, it is now our time, \\n That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper, \\n To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady! \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady, \\n I wish you all the joy that you can wish; \\n For I am sure you can wish none from me: \\n And when your honours mean to solemnize \\n The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you, \\n Even at that time I may be married too. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n I thank your lordship, you have got me one. \\n My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours: \\n You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid; \\n You loved, I loved for intermission. \\n No more pertains to me, my lord, than you. \\n Your fortune stood upon the casket there, \\n And so did mine too, as the matter falls; \\n For wooing here until I sweat again, \\n And sweating until my very roof was dry \\n With oaths of love, at last, if promise last, \\n I got a promise of this fair one here \\n To have her love, provided that your fortune \\n Achieved her mistress. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Is this true, Nerissa? \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Yes, faith, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n What, and stake down? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down. \\n But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What, \\n and my old Venetian friend Salerio? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger\\nfrom Venice \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither; \\n If that the youth of my new interest here \\n Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave, \\n I bid my very friends and countrymen, \\n Sweet Portia, welcome. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n So do I, my lord: \\n They are entirely welcome. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n I thank your honour. For my part, my lord, \\n My purpose was not to have seen you here; \\n But meeting with Salerio by the way, \\n He did entreat me, past all saying nay, \\n To come with him along. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALERIO \\n I did, my lord; \\n And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio \\n Commends him to you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Gives Bassanio a letter \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Ere I ope his letter, \\n I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALERIO \\n Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind; \\n Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there \\n Will show you his estate. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome. \\n Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice? \\n How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio? \\n I know he will be glad of our success; \\n We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALERIO \\n I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper, \\n That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek: \\n Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world \\n Could turn so much the constitution \\n Of any constant man. What, worse and worse! \\n With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself, \\n And I must freely have the half of anything \\n That this same paper brings you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n O sweet Portia, \\n Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words \\n That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady, \\n When I did first impart my love to you, \\n I freely told you, all the wealth I had \\n Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman; \\n And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady, \\n Rating myself at nothing, you shall see \\n How much I was a braggart. When I told you \\n My state was nothing, I should then have told you \\n That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed, \\n I have engaged myself to a dear friend, \\n Engaged my friend to his mere enemy, \\n To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady; \\n The paper as the body of my friend, \\n And every word in it a gaping wound, \\n Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio? \\n Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit? \\n From Tripolis, from Mexico and England, \\n From Lisbon, Barbary and India? \\n And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch \\n Of merchant-marring rocks? \\n \\n\\n \\n SALERIO \\n Not one, my lord. \\n Besides, it should appear, that if he had \\n The present money to discharge the Jew, \\n He would not take it. Never did I know \\n A creature, that did bear the shape of man, \\n So keen and greedy to confound a man: \\n He plies the duke at morning and at night, \\n And doth impeach the freedom of the state, \\n If they deny him justice: twenty merchants, \\n The duke himself, and the magnificoes \\n Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him; \\n But none can drive him from the envious plea \\n Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n When I was with him I have heard him swear \\n To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, \\n That he would rather have Antonio's flesh \\n Than twenty times the value of the sum \\n That he did owe him: and I know, my lord, \\n If law, authority and power deny not, \\n It will go hard with poor Antonio. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, \\n The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit \\n In doing courtesies, and one in whom \\n The ancient Roman honour more appears \\n Than any that draws breath in Italy. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n What sum owes he the Jew? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n For me three thousand ducats. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n What, no more? \\n Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond; \\n Double six thousand, and then treble that, \\n Before a friend of this description \\n Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault. \\n First go with me to church and call me wife, \\n And then away to Venice to your friend; \\n For never shall you lie by Portia's side \\n With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold \\n To pay the petty debt twenty times over: \\n When it is paid, bring your true friend along. \\n My maid Nerissa and myself meantime \\n Will live as maids and widows. Come, away! \\n For you shall hence upon your wedding-day: \\n Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer: \\n Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear. \\n But let me hear the letter of your friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Reads   Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all \\n miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is \\n very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since \\n in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all \\n debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but \\n see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your \\n pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come, \\n let not my letter. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n O love, dispatch all business, and be gone! \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Since I have your good leave to go away, \\n I will make haste: but, till I come again, \\n No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, \\n No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Venice. A street. \\n Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy; \\n This is the fool that lent out money gratis: \\n Gaoler, look to him. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Hear me yet, good Shylock. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond: \\n I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. \\n Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause; \\n But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs: \\n The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, \\n Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond \\n To come abroad with him at his request. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I pray thee, hear me speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak: \\n I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more. \\n I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, \\n To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield \\n To Christian intercessors. Follow not; \\n I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n It is the most impenetrable cur \\n That ever kept with men. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Let him alone: \\n I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers. \\n He seeks my life; his reason well I know: \\n I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures \\n Many that have at times made moan to me; \\n Therefore he hates me. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALARINO \\n I am sure the duke \\n Will never grant this forfeiture to hold. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n The duke cannot deny the course of law: \\n For the commodity that strangers have \\n With us in Venice, if it be denied, \\n Will much impeach the justice of his state; \\n Since that the trade and profit of the city \\n Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go: \\n These griefs and losses have so bated me, \\n That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh \\n To-morrow to my bloody creditor. \\n Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come \\n To see me pay his debt, and then I care not! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house. \\n Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and\\nBALTHASAR \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Madam, although I speak it in your presence, \\n You have a noble and a true conceit \\n Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly \\n In bearing thus the absence of your lord. \\n But if you knew to whom you show this honour, \\n How true a gentleman you send relief, \\n How dear a lover of my lord your husband, \\n I know you would be prouder of the work \\n Than customary bounty can enforce you. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I never did repent for doing good, \\n Nor shall not now: for in companions \\n That do converse and waste the time together, \\n Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love, \\n There must be needs a like proportion \\n Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit; \\n Which makes me think that this Antonio, \\n Being the bosom lover of my lord, \\n Must needs be like my lord. If it be so, \\n How little is the cost I have bestow'd \\n In purchasing the semblance of my soul \\n From out the state of hellish misery! \\n This comes too near the praising of myself; \\n Therefore no more of it: hear other things. \\n Lorenzo, I commit into your hands \\n The husbandry and manage of my house \\n Until my lord's return: for mine own part, \\n I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow \\n To live in prayer and contemplation, \\n Only attended by Nerissa here, \\n Until her husband and my lord's return: \\n There is a monastery two miles off; \\n And there will we abide. I do desire you \\n Not to deny this imposition; \\n The which my love and some necessity \\n Now lays upon you. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Madam, with all my heart; \\n I shall obey you in all fair commands. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n My people do already know my mind, \\n And will acknowledge you and Jessica \\n In place of Lord Bassanio and myself. \\n And so farewell, till we shall meet again. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you! \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n I wish your ladyship all heart's content. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased \\n To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica. \\n Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO \\n Now, Balthasar, \\n As I have ever found thee honest-true, \\n So let me find thee still. Take this same letter, \\n And use thou all the endeavour of a man \\n In speed to Padua: see thou render this \\n Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario; \\n And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee, \\n Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed \\n Unto the tranect, to the common ferry \\n Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words, \\n But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n Madam, I go with all convenient speed. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand \\n That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands \\n Before they think of us. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Shall they see us? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit, \\n That they shall think we are accomplished \\n With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager, \\n When we are both accoutred like young men, \\n I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two, \\n And wear my dagger with the braver grace, \\n And speak between the change of man and boy \\n With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps \\n Into a manly stride, and speak of frays \\n Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies, \\n How honourable ladies sought my love, \\n Which I denying, they fell sick and died; \\n I could not do withal; then I'll repent, \\n And wish for all that, that I had not killed them; \\n And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell, \\n That men shall swear I have discontinued school \\n Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind \\n A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks, \\n Which I will practise. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Why, shall we turn to men? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Fie, what a question's that, \\n If thou wert near a lewd interpreter! \\n But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device \\n When I am in my coach, which stays for us \\n At the park gate; and therefore haste away, \\n For we must measure twenty miles to-day. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  The same. A garden. \\n Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father \\n are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I \\n promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with \\n you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter: \\n therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you \\n are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do \\n you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard \\n hope neither. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n And what hope is that, I pray thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you \\n not, that you are not the Jew's daughter. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the \\n sins of my mother should be visited upon me. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and \\n mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I \\n fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are \\n gone both ways. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a \\n Christian. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians \\n enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by \\n another. This making Christians will raise the \\n price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we \\n shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LORENZO \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if \\n you thus get my wife into corners. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I \\n are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for \\n me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he \\n says, you are no good member of the commonwealth, \\n for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the \\n price of pork. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than \\n you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the \\n Moor is with child by you, Launcelot. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n It is much that the Moor should be more than reason: \\n but if she be less than an honest woman, she is \\n indeed more than I took her for. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n How every fool can play upon the word! I think the \\n best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, \\n and discourse grow commendable in none only but \\n parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n That is done, sir; they have all stomachs. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid \\n them prepare dinner. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Will you cover then, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show \\n the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray \\n tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning: \\n go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve \\n in the meat, and we will come in to dinner. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the \\n meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in \\n to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and \\n conceits shall govern. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n O dear discretion, how his words are suited! \\n The fool hath planted in his memory \\n An army of good words; and I do know \\n A many fools, that stand in better place, \\n Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word \\n Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica? \\n And now, good sweet, say thy opinion, \\n How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife? \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Past all expressing. It is very meet \\n The Lord Bassanio live an upright life; \\n For, having such a blessing in his lady, \\n He finds the joys of heaven here on earth; \\n And if on earth he do not mean it, then \\n In reason he should never come to heaven \\n Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match \\n And on the wager lay two earthly women, \\n And Portia one, there must be something else \\n Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world \\n Hath not her fellow. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Even such a husband \\n Hast thou of me as she is for a wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Nay, but ask my opinion too of that. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n I will anon: first, let us go to dinner. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk; \\n ' Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things \\n I shall digest it. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n Well, I'll set you forth. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT IV \\n\\n SCENE I.  Venice. A court of justice. \\n Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO,\\nGRATIANO, SALERIO, and others \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n What, is Antonio here? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Ready, so please your grace. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer \\n A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch \\n uncapable of pity, void and empty \\n From any dram of mercy. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I have heard \\n Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify \\n His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate \\n And that no lawful means can carry me \\n Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose \\n My patience to his fury, and am arm'd \\n To suffer, with a quietness of spirit, \\n The very tyranny and rage of his. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Go one, and call the Jew into the court. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALERIO \\n He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter SHYLOCK \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Make room, and let him stand before our face. \\n Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, \\n That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice \\n To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought \\n Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange \\n Than is thy strange apparent cruelty; \\n And where thou now exact'st the penalty, \\n Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh, \\n Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, \\n But, touch'd with human gentleness and love, \\n Forgive a moiety of the principal; \\n Glancing an eye of pity on his losses, \\n That have of late so huddled on his back, \\n Enow to press a royal merchant down \\n And pluck commiseration of his state \\n From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint, \\n From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd \\n To offices of tender courtesy. \\n We all expect a gentle answer, Jew. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose; \\n And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn \\n To have the due and forfeit of my bond: \\n If you deny it, let the danger light \\n Upon your charter and your city's freedom. \\n You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have \\n A weight of carrion flesh than to receive \\n Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that: \\n But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd? \\n What if my house be troubled with a rat \\n And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats \\n To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet? \\n Some men there are love not a gaping pig; \\n Some, that are mad if they behold a cat; \\n And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose, \\n Cannot contain their urine: for affection, \\n Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood \\n Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer: \\n As there is no firm reason to be render'd, \\n Why he cannot abide a gaping pig; \\n Why he, a harmless necessary cat; \\n Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force \\n Must yield to such inevitable shame \\n As to offend, himself being offended; \\n So can I give no reason, nor I will not, \\n More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing \\n I bear Antonio, that I follow thus \\n A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, \\n To excuse the current of thy cruelty. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I am not bound to please thee with my answers. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Do all men kill the things they do not love? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Hates any man the thing he would not kill? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Every offence is not a hate at first. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I pray you, think you question with the Jew: \\n You may as well go stand upon the beach \\n And bid the main flood bate his usual height; \\n You may as well use question with the wolf \\n Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb; \\n You may as well forbid the mountain pines \\n To wag their high tops and to make no noise, \\n When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven; \\n You may as well do anything most hard, \\n As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?-- \\n His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you, \\n Make no more offers, use no farther means, \\n But with all brief and plain conveniency \\n Let me have judgment and the Jew his will. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n For thy three thousand ducats here is six. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n What judgment shall I dread, doing \\n Were in six parts and every part a ducat, \\n I would not draw them; I would have my bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? \\n You have among you many a purchased slave, \\n Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules, \\n You use in abject and in slavish parts, \\n Because you bought them: shall I say to you, \\n Let them be free, marry them to your heirs? \\n Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds \\n Be made as soft as yours and let their palates \\n Be season'd with such viands? You will answer \\n 'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you: \\n The pound of flesh, which I demand of him, \\n Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it. \\n If you deny me, fie upon your law! \\n There is no force in the decrees of Venice. \\n I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it? \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Upon my power I may dismiss this court, \\n Unless Bellario, a learned doctor, \\n Whom I have sent for to determine this, \\n Come here to-day. \\n \\n\\n \\n SALERIO \\n My lord, here stays without \\n A messenger with letters from the doctor, \\n New come from Padua. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Bring us the letter; call the messenger. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet! \\n The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all, \\n Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I am a tainted wether of the flock, \\n Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit \\n Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me \\n You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio, \\n Than to live still and write mine epitaph. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Came you from Padua, from Bellario? \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace. \\n \\n\\n\\n Presenting a letter \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, \\n Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can, \\n No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness \\n Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n No, none that thou hast wit enough to make. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog! \\n And for thy life let justice be accused. \\n Thou almost makest me waver in my faith \\n To hold opinion with Pythagoras, \\n That souls of animals infuse themselves \\n Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit \\n Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter, \\n Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, \\n And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam, \\n Infused itself in thee; for thy desires \\n Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, \\n Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud: \\n Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall \\n To cureless ruin. I stand here for law. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n This letter from Bellario doth commend \\n A young and learned doctor to our court. \\n Where is he? \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n He attendeth here hard by, \\n To know your answer, whether you'll admit him. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n With all my heart. Some three or four of you \\n Go give him courteous conduct to this place. \\n Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clerk \\n Reads \\n Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of \\n your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that \\n your messenger came, in loving visitation was with \\n me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I \\n acquainted him with the cause in controversy between \\n the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er \\n many books together: he is furnished with my \\n opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the \\n greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes \\n with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's \\n request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of \\n years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend \\n estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so \\n old a head. I leave him to your gracious \\n acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his \\n commendation. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes: \\n And here, I take it, is the doctor come. \\n Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws \\n Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I did, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n You are welcome: take your place. \\n Are you acquainted with the difference \\n That holds this present question in the court? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I am informed thoroughly of the cause. \\n Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew? \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Is your name Shylock? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Shylock is my name. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Of a strange nature is the suit you follow; \\n Yet in such rule that the Venetian law \\n Cannot impugn you as you do proceed. \\n You stand within his danger, do you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Ay, so he says. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Do you confess the bond? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I do. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Then must the Jew be merciful. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n On what compulsion must I? tell me that. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n The quality of mercy is not strain'd, \\n It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven \\n Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; \\n It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: \\n 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes \\n The throned monarch better than his crown; \\n His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, \\n The attribute to awe and majesty, \\n Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; \\n But mercy is above this sceptred sway; \\n It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, \\n It is an attribute to God himself; \\n And earthly power doth then show likest God's \\n When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, \\n Though justice be thy plea, consider this, \\n That, in the course of justice, none of us \\n Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; \\n And that same prayer doth teach us all to render \\n The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much \\n To mitigate the justice of thy plea; \\n Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice \\n Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, \\n The penalty and forfeit of my bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Is he not able to discharge the money? \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Yes, here I tender it for him in the court; \\n Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice, \\n I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, \\n On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart: \\n If this will not suffice, it must appear \\n That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, \\n Wrest once the law to your authority: \\n To do a great right, do a little wrong, \\n And curb this cruel devil of his will. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n It must not be; there is no power in Venice \\n Can alter a decree established: \\n 'Twill be recorded for a precedent, \\n And many an error by the same example \\n Will rush into the state: it cannot be. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel! \\n O wise young judge, how I do honour thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I pray you, let me look upon the bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven: \\n Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? \\n No, not for Venice. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Why, this bond is forfeit; \\n And lawfully by this the Jew may claim \\n A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off \\n Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful: \\n Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n When it is paid according to the tenor. \\n It doth appear you are a worthy judge; \\n You know the law, your exposition \\n Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law, \\n Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar, \\n Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear \\n There is no power in the tongue of man \\n To alter me: I stay here on my bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Most heartily I do beseech the court \\n To give the judgment. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Why then, thus it is: \\n You must prepare your bosom for his knife. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n O noble judge! O excellent young man! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n For the intent and purpose of the law \\n Hath full relation to the penalty, \\n Which here appeareth due upon the bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n 'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge! \\n How much more elder art thou than thy looks! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Therefore lay bare your bosom. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Ay, his breast: \\n So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge? \\n 'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n It is so. Are there balance here to weigh \\n The flesh? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I have them ready. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, \\n To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Is it so nominated in the bond? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n It is not so express'd: but what of that? \\n 'Twere good you do so much for charity. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n You, merchant, have you any thing to say? \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n But little: I am arm'd and well prepared. \\n Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well! \\n Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you; \\n For herein Fortune shows herself more kind \\n Than is her custom: it is still her use \\n To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, \\n To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow \\n An age of poverty; from which lingering penance \\n Of such misery doth she cut me off. \\n Commend me to your honourable wife: \\n Tell her the process of Antonio's end; \\n Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death; \\n And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge \\n Whether Bassanio had not once a love. \\n Repent but you that you shall lose your friend, \\n And he repents not that he pays your debt; \\n For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, \\n I'll pay it presently with all my heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Antonio, I am married to a wife \\n Which is as dear to me as life itself; \\n But life itself, my wife, and all the world, \\n Are not with me esteem'd above thy life: \\n I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all \\n Here to this devil, to deliver you. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Your wife would give you little thanks for that, \\n If she were by, to hear you make the offer. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love: \\n I would she were in heaven, so she could \\n Entreat some power to change this currish Jew. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n 'Tis well you offer it behind her back; \\n The wish would make else an unquiet house. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter; \\n Would any of the stock of Barrabas \\n Had been her husband rather than a Christian! \\n Aside \\n We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine: \\n The court awards it, and the law doth give it. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Most rightful judge! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n And you must cut this flesh from off his breast: \\n The law allows it, and the court awards it. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Tarry a little; there is something else. \\n This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood; \\n The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:' \\n Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh; \\n But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed \\n One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods \\n Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate \\n Unto the state of Venice. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge! \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Is that the law? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Thyself shalt see the act: \\n For, as thou urgest justice, be assured \\n Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge! \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice \\n And let the Christian go. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Here is the money. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Soft! \\n The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste: \\n He shall have nothing but the penalty. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh. \\n Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more \\n But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more \\n Or less than a just pound, be it but so much \\n As makes it light or heavy in the substance, \\n Or the division of the twentieth part \\n Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn \\n But in the estimation of a hair, \\n Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew! \\n Now, infidel, I have you on the hip. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Give me my principal, and let me go. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n I have it ready for thee; here it is. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n He hath refused it in the open court: \\n He shall have merely justice and his bond. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel! \\n I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Shall I not have barely my principal? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture, \\n To be so taken at thy peril, Jew. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Why, then the devil give him good of it! \\n I'll stay no longer question. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Tarry, Jew: \\n The law hath yet another hold on you. \\n It is enacted in the laws of Venice, \\n If it be proved against an alien \\n That by direct or indirect attempts \\n He seek the life of any citizen, \\n The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive \\n Shall seize one half his goods; the other half \\n Comes to the privy coffer of the state; \\n And the offender's life lies in the mercy \\n Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice. \\n In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st; \\n For it appears, by manifest proceeding, \\n That indirectly and directly too \\n Thou hast contrived against the very life \\n Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd \\n The danger formerly by me rehearsed. \\n Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself: \\n And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, \\n Thou hast not left the value of a cord; \\n Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits, \\n I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it: \\n For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's; \\n The other half comes to the general state, \\n Which humbleness may drive unto a fine. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Ay, for the state, not for Antonio. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that: \\n You take my house when you do take the prop \\n That doth sustain my house; you take my life \\n When you do take the means whereby I live. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n What mercy can you render him, Antonio? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n So please my lord the duke and all the court \\n To quit the fine for one half of his goods, \\n I am content; so he will let me have \\n The other half in use, to render it, \\n Upon his death, unto the gentleman \\n That lately stole his daughter: \\n Two things provided more, that, for this favour, \\n He presently become a Christian; \\n The other, that he do record a gift, \\n Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd, \\n Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n He shall do this, or else I do recant \\n The pardon that I late pronounced here. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say? \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I am content. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Clerk, draw a deed of gift. \\n \\n\\n \\n SHYLOCK \\n I pray you, give me leave to go from hence; \\n I am not well: send the deed after me, \\n And I will sign it. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Get thee gone, but do it. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers: \\n Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more, \\n To bring thee to the gallows, not the font. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit SHYLOCK \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I humbly do desire your grace of pardon: \\n I must away this night toward Padua, \\n And it is meet I presently set forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE \\n I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. \\n Antonio, gratify this gentleman, \\n For, in my mind, you are much bound to him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Duke and his train \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend \\n Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted \\n Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof, \\n Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, \\n We freely cope your courteous pains withal. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n And stand indebted, over and above, \\n In love and service to you evermore. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n He is well paid that is well satisfied; \\n And I, delivering you, am satisfied \\n And therein do account myself well paid: \\n My mind was never yet more mercenary. \\n I pray you, know me when we meet again: \\n I wish you well, and so I take my leave. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further: \\n Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute, \\n Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you, \\n Not to deny me, and to pardon me. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n You press me far, and therefore I will yield. \\n To ANTONIO \\n Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake; \\n To BASSANIO \\n And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you: \\n Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more; \\n And you in love shall not deny me this. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle! \\n I will not shame myself to give you this. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I will have nothing else but only this; \\n And now methinks I have a mind to it. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n There's more depends on this than on the value. \\n The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, \\n And find it out by proclamation: \\n Only for this, I pray you, pardon me. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I see, sir, you are liberal in offers \\n You taught me first to beg; and now methinks \\n You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife; \\n And when she put it on, she made me vow \\n That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts. \\n An if your wife be not a mad-woman, \\n And know how well I have deserved the ring, \\n She would not hold out enemy for ever, \\n For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Portia and Nerissa \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring: \\n Let his deservings and my love withal \\n Be valued against your wife's commandment. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him; \\n Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst, \\n Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste. \\n Exit Gratiano \\n Come, you and I will thither presently; \\n And in the morning early will we both \\n Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.

Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house. \\n Enter LORENZO and JESSICA \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n The moon shines bright: in such a night as this, \\n When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees \\n And they did make no noise, in such a night \\n Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls \\n And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents, \\n Where Cressid lay that night. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n In such a night \\n Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew \\n And saw the lion's shadow ere himself \\n And ran dismay'd away. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n In such a night \\n Stood Dido with a willow in her hand \\n Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love \\n To come again to Carthage. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n In such a night \\n Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs \\n That did renew old AEson. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n In such a night \\n Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew \\n And with an unthrift love did run from Venice \\n As far as Belmont. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n In such a night \\n Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well, \\n Stealing her soul with many vows of faith \\n And ne'er a true one. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n In such a night \\n Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, \\n Slander her love, and he forgave it her. \\n \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n I would out-night you, did no body come; \\n But, hark, I hear the footing of a man. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter STEPHANO \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Who comes so fast in silence of the night? \\n \\n\\n \\n STEPHANO \\n A friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend? \\n \\n\\n \\n STEPHANO \\n Stephano is my name; and I bring word \\n My mistress will before the break of day \\n Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about \\n By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays \\n For happy wedlock hours. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Who comes with her? \\n \\n\\n \\n STEPHANO \\n None but a holy hermit and her maid. \\n I pray you, is my master yet return'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n He is not, nor we have not heard from him. \\n But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, \\n And ceremoniously let us prepare \\n Some welcome for the mistress of the house. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LAUNCELOT \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Who calls? \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo? \\n Master Lorenzo, sola, sola! \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Leave hollaing, man: here. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Sola! where? where? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Here. \\n \\n\\n \\n LAUNCELOT \\n Tell him there's a post come from my master, with \\n his horn full of good news: my master will be here \\n ere morning. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming. \\n And yet no matter: why should we go in? \\n My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, \\n Within the house, your mistress is at hand; \\n And bring your music forth into the air. \\n Exit Stephano \\n How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! \\n Here will we sit and let the sounds of music \\n Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night \\n Become the touches of sweet harmony. \\n Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven \\n Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold: \\n There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st \\n But in his motion like an angel sings, \\n Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins; \\n Such harmony is in immortal souls; \\n But whilst this muddy vesture of decay \\n Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. \\n Enter Musicians \\n Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn! \\n With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, \\n And draw her home with music. \\n \\n\\n\\n Music \\n\\n \\n JESSICA \\n I am never merry when I hear sweet music. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n The reason is, your spirits are attentive: \\n For do but note a wild and wanton herd, \\n Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, \\n Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, \\n Which is the hot condition of their blood; \\n If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, \\n Or any air of music touch their ears, \\n You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, \\n Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze \\n By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet \\n Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods; \\n Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage, \\n But music for the time doth change his nature. \\n The man that hath no music in himself, \\n Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, \\n Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils; \\n The motions of his spirit are dull as night \\n And his affections dark as Erebus: \\n Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter PORTIA and NERISSA \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n That light we see is burning in my hall. \\n How far that little candle throws his beams! \\n So shines a good deed in a naughty world. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n When the moon shone, we did not see the candle. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n So doth the greater glory dim the less: \\n A substitute shines brightly as a king \\n Unto the king be by, and then his state \\n Empties itself, as doth an inland brook \\n Into the main of waters. Music! hark! \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n It is your music, madam, of the house. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Nothing is good, I see, without respect: \\n Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark, \\n When neither is attended, and I think \\n The nightingale, if she should sing by day, \\n When every goose is cackling, would be thought \\n No better a musician than the wren. \\n How many things by season season'd are \\n To their right praise and true perfection! \\n Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion \\n And would not be awaked. \\n \\n\\n\\n Music ceases \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n That is the voice, \\n Or I am much deceived, of Portia. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, \\n By the bad voice. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Dear lady, welcome home. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n We have been praying for our husbands' healths, \\n Which speed, we hope, the better for our words. \\n Are they return'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Madam, they are not yet; \\n But there is come a messenger before, \\n To signify their coming. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Go in, Nerissa; \\n Give order to my servants that they take \\n No note at all of our being absent hence; \\n Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you. \\n \\n\\n\\n A tucket sounds \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet: \\n We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n This night methinks is but the daylight sick; \\n It looks a little paler: 'tis a day, \\n Such as the day is when the sun is hid. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and\\ntheir followers \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n We should hold day with the Antipodes, \\n If you would walk in absence of the sun. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Let me give light, but let me not be light; \\n For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, \\n And never be Bassanio so for me: \\n But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend. \\n This is the man, this is Antonio, \\n To whom I am so infinitely bound. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n You should in all sense be much bound to him. \\n For, as I hear, he was much bound for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n No more than I am well acquitted of. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Sir, you are very welcome to our house: \\n It must appear in other ways than words, \\n Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n To NERISSA   By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong; \\n In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk: \\n Would he were gelt that had it, for my part, \\n Since you do take it, love, so much at heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring \\n That she did give me, whose posy was \\n For all the world like cutler's poetry \\n Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.' \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n What talk you of the posy or the value? \\n You swore to me, when I did give it you, \\n That you would wear it till your hour of death \\n And that it should lie with you in your grave: \\n Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, \\n You should have been respective and have kept it. \\n Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge, \\n The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n He will, an if he live to be a man. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Ay, if a woman live to be a man. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, \\n A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy, \\n No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk, \\n A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee: \\n I could not for my heart deny it him. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n You were to blame, I must be plain with you, \\n To part so slightly with your wife's first gift: \\n A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger \\n And so riveted with faith unto your flesh. \\n I gave my love a ring and made him swear \\n Never to part with it; and here he stands; \\n I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it \\n Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth \\n That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, \\n You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief: \\n An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Aside   Why, I were best to cut my left hand off \\n And swear I lost the ring defending it. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away \\n Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed \\n Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk, \\n That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine; \\n And neither man nor master would take aught \\n But the two rings. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n What ring gave you my lord? \\n Not that, I hope, which you received of me. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n If I could add a lie unto a fault, \\n I would deny it; but you see my finger \\n Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Even so void is your false heart of truth. \\n By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed \\n Until I see the ring. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Nor I in yours \\n Till I again see mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Sweet Portia, \\n If you did know to whom I gave the ring, \\n If you did know for whom I gave the ring \\n And would conceive for what I gave the ring \\n And how unwillingly I left the ring, \\n When nought would be accepted but the ring, \\n You would abate the strength of your displeasure. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n If you had known the virtue of the ring, \\n Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, \\n Or your own honour to contain the ring, \\n You would not then have parted with the ring. \\n What man is there so much unreasonable, \\n If you had pleased to have defended it \\n With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty \\n To urge the thing held as a ceremony? \\n Nerissa teaches me what to believe: \\n I'll die for't but some woman had the ring. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, \\n No woman had it, but a civil doctor, \\n Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me \\n And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him \\n And suffer'd him to go displeased away; \\n Even he that did uphold the very life \\n Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady? \\n I was enforced to send it after him; \\n I was beset with shame and courtesy; \\n My honour would not let ingratitude \\n So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady; \\n For, by these blessed candles of the night, \\n Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd \\n The ring of me to give the worthy doctor. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Let not that doctor e'er come near my house: \\n Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, \\n And that which you did swear to keep for me, \\n I will become as liberal as you; \\n I'll not deny him any thing I have, \\n No, not my body nor my husband's bed: \\n Know him I shall, I am well sure of it: \\n Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus: \\n If you do not, if I be left alone, \\n Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own, \\n I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n And I his clerk; therefore be well advised \\n How you do leave me to mine own protection. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Well, do you so; let not me take him, then; \\n For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong; \\n And, in the hearing of these many friends, \\n I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes, \\n Wherein I see myself-- \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Mark you but that! \\n In both my eyes he doubly sees himself; \\n In each eye, one: swear by your double self, \\n And there's an oath of credit. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Nay, but hear me: \\n Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear \\n I never more will break an oath with thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I once did lend my body for his wealth; \\n Which, but for him that had your husband's ring, \\n Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again, \\n My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord \\n Will never more break faith advisedly. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Then you shall be his surety. Give him this \\n And bid him keep it better than the other. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor! \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio; \\n For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano; \\n For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk, \\n In lieu of this last night did lie with me. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Why, this is like the mending of highways \\n In summer, where the ways are fair enough: \\n What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it? \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed: \\n Here is a letter; read it at your leisure; \\n It comes from Padua, from Bellario: \\n There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, \\n Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here \\n Shall witness I set forth as soon as you \\n And even but now return'd; I have not yet \\n Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome; \\n And I have better news in store for you \\n Than you expect: unseal this letter soon; \\n There you shall find three of your argosies \\n Are richly come to harbour suddenly: \\n You shall not know by what strange accident \\n I chanced on this letter. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n I am dumb. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Were you the doctor and I knew you not? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold? \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, \\n Unless he live until he be a man. \\n \\n\\n \\n BASSANIO \\n Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow: \\n When I am absent, then lie with my wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n ANTONIO \\n Sweet lady, you have given me life and living; \\n For here I read for certain that my ships \\n Are safely come to road. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n How now, Lorenzo! \\n My clerk hath some good comforts too for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n NERISSA \\n Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee. \\n There do I give to you and Jessica, \\n From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift, \\n After his death, of all he dies possess'd of. \\n \\n\\n \\n LORENZO \\n Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way \\n Of starved people. \\n \\n\\n \\n PORTIA \\n It is almost morning, \\n And yet I am sure you are not satisfied \\n Of these events at full. Let us go in; \\n And charge us there upon inter'gatories, \\n And we will answer all things faithfully. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Let it be so: the first inter'gatory \\n That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is, \\n Whether till the next night she had rather stay, \\n Or go to bed now, being two hours to day: \\n But were the day come, I should wish it dark, \\n That I were couching with the doctor's clerk. \\n Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing \\n So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n TITLE \\n\\n\\n\\n The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice \\n\\n\\n\\n PERSONAE \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dramatis Personae \\n\\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n BRABANTIO, a senator. \\n Other Senators. \\n GRATIANO, brother to Brabantio. \\n LODOVICO, kinsman to Brabantio. \\n OTHELLO, a noble Moor in the service of the Venetian state. \\n CASSIO, his lieutenant. \\n IAGO, his ancient. \\n RODERIGO, a Venetian gentleman. \\n MONTANO, Othello's predecessor in the government of Cyprus. \\n Clown, servant to Othello.  \\n DESDEMONA, daughter to Brabantio and wife to Othello. \\n EMILIA, wife to Iago. \\n BIANCA, mistress to Cassio. \\n Sailor, Messenger, Herald, Officers, Gentlemen, Musicians, and Attendants. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n SCNDESCR \\n\\n\\n\\n SCENE  Venice: a Sea-port in Cyprus. \\n\\n\\n\\n PLAYSUBT \\n\\n\\n\\n OTHELLO \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT I \\n\\n SCENE I.  Venice. A street. \\n Enter RODERIGO and IAGO \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly \\n That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse \\n As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Sblood, but you will not hear me: \\n If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city, \\n In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, \\n Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man, \\n I know my price, I am worth no worse a place: \\n But he; as loving his own pride and purposes, \\n Evades them, with a bombast circumstance \\n Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war; \\n And, in conclusion, \\n Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he, \\n 'I have already chose my officer.' \\n And what was he? \\n Forsooth, a great arithmetician, \\n One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, \\n A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife; \\n That never set a squadron in the field, \\n Nor the division of a battle knows \\n More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, \\n Wherein the toged consuls can propose \\n As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise, \\n Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election: \\n And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof \\n At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds \\n Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd \\n By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster, \\n He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, \\n And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service, \\n Preferment goes by letter and affection, \\n And not by old gradation, where each second \\n Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself, \\n Whether I in any just term am affined \\n To love the Moor. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I would not follow him then. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O, sir, content you; \\n I follow him to serve my turn upon him: \\n We cannot all be masters, nor all masters \\n Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark \\n Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, \\n That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, \\n Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, \\n For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd: \\n Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are \\n Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, \\n Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, \\n And, throwing but shows of service on their lords, \\n Do well thrive by them and when they have lined \\n their coats \\n Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul; \\n And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, \\n It is as sure as you are Roderigo, \\n Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: \\n In following him, I follow but myself; \\n Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, \\n But seeming so, for my peculiar end: \\n For when my outward action doth demonstrate \\n The native act and figure of my heart \\n In compliment extern, 'tis not long after \\n But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve \\n For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n What a full fortune does the thicklips owe \\n If he can carry't thus! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Call up her father, \\n Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight, \\n Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen, \\n And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, \\n Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy, \\n Yet throw such changes of vexation on't, \\n As it may lose some colour. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell \\n As when, by night and negligence, the fire \\n Is spied in populous cities. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves! \\n Look to your house, your daughter and your bags! \\n Thieves! thieves! \\n \\n\\n\\n BRABANTIO appears above, at a window \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n What is the reason of this terrible summons? \\n What is the matter there? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Signior, is all your family within? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Are your doors lock'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Why, wherefore ask you this? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on \\n your gown; \\n Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; \\n Even now, now, very now, an old black ram \\n Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise; \\n Awake the snorting citizens with the bell, \\n Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you: \\n Arise, I say. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n What, have you lost your wits? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Most reverend signior, do you know my voice? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Not I what are you? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n My name is Roderigo. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n The worser welcome: \\n I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors: \\n In honest plainness thou hast heard me say \\n My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness, \\n Being full of supper and distempering draughts, \\n Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come \\n To start my quiet. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Sir, sir, sir,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n But thou must needs be sure \\n My spirit and my place have in them power \\n To make this bitter to thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Patience, good sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice; \\n My house is not a grange. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Most grave Brabantio, \\n In simple and pure soul I come to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not \\n serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to \\n do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll \\n have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; \\n you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have \\n coursers for cousins and gennets for germans. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n What profane wretch art thou? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter \\n and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Thou art a villain. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You are--a senator. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you, \\n If't be your pleasure and most wise consent, \\n As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter, \\n At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night, \\n Transported, with no worse nor better guard \\n But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, \\n To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor-- \\n If this be known to you and your allowance, \\n We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs; \\n But if you know not this, my manners tell me \\n We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe \\n That, from the sense of all civility, \\n I thus would play and trifle with your reverence: \\n Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, \\n I say again, hath made a gross revolt; \\n Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes \\n In an extravagant and wheeling stranger \\n Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself: \\n If she be in her chamber or your house, \\n Let loose on me the justice of the state \\n For thus deluding you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Strike on the tinder, ho! \\n Give me a taper! call up all my people! \\n This accident is not unlike my dream: \\n Belief of it oppresses me already. \\n Light, I say! light! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit above \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Farewell; for I must leave you: \\n It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, \\n To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall-- \\n Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state, \\n However this may gall him with some cheque, \\n Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd \\n With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, \\n Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls, \\n Another of his fathom they have none, \\n To lead their business: in which regard, \\n Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains. \\n Yet, for necessity of present life, \\n I must show out a flag and sign of love, \\n Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him, \\n Lead to the Sagittary the raised search; \\n And there will I be with him. So, farewell. \\n \\n\\n Exit \\n Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n It is too true an evil: gone she is; \\n And what's to come of my despised time \\n Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, \\n Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl! \\n With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father! \\n How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me \\n Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers: \\n Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Truly, I think they are. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! \\n Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds \\n By what you see them act. Is there not charms \\n By which the property of youth and maidhood \\n May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, \\n Of some such thing? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Yes, sir, I have indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Call up my brother. O, would you had had her! \\n Some one way, some another. Do you know \\n Where we may apprehend her and the Moor? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I think I can discover him, if you please, \\n To get good guard and go along with me. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call; \\n I may command at most. Get weapons, ho! \\n And raise some special officers of night. \\n On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Another street. \\n Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Though in the trade of war I have slain men, \\n Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience \\n To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity \\n Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times \\n I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n 'Tis better as it is. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Nay, but he prated, \\n And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms \\n Against your honour \\n That, with the little godliness I have, \\n I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir, \\n Are you fast married? Be assured of this, \\n That the magnifico is much beloved, \\n And hath in his effect a voice potential \\n As double as the duke's: he will divorce you; \\n Or put upon you what restraint and grievance \\n The law, with all his might to enforce it on, \\n Will give him cable. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Let him do his spite: \\n My services which I have done the signiory \\n Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,-- \\n Which, when I know that boasting is an honour, \\n I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being \\n From men of royal siege, and my demerits \\n May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune \\n As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago, \\n But that I love the gentle Desdemona, \\n I would not my unhoused free condition \\n Put into circumscription and confine \\n For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Those are the raised father and his friends: \\n You were best go in. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Not I I must be found: \\n My parts, my title and my perfect soul \\n Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n By Janus, I think no. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant. \\n The goodness of the night upon you, friends! \\n What is the news? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n The duke does greet you, general, \\n And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, \\n Even on the instant. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What is the matter, think you? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Something from Cyprus as I may divine: \\n It is a business of some heat: the galleys \\n Have sent a dozen sequent messengers \\n This very night at one another's heels, \\n And many of the consuls, raised and met, \\n Are at the duke's already: you have been \\n hotly call'd for; \\n When, being not at your lodging to be found, \\n The senate hath sent about three several guests \\n To search you out. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n 'Tis well I am found by you. \\n I will but spend a word here in the house, \\n And go with you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Ancient, what makes he here? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack: \\n If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I do not understand. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n He's married. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n To who? \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter OTHELLO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Have with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Here comes another troop to seek for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n It is Brabantio. General, be advised; \\n He comes to bad intent. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with\\ntorches and weapons \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Holla! stand there! \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Signior, it is the Moor. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Down with him, thief! \\n \\n\\n\\n They draw on both sides \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. \\n Good signior, you shall more command with years \\n Than with your weapons. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter? \\n Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her; \\n For I'll refer me to all things of sense, \\n If she in chains of magic were not bound, \\n Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy, \\n So opposite to marriage that she shunned \\n The wealthy curled darlings of our nation, \\n Would ever have, to incur a general mock, \\n Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom \\n Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight. \\n Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense \\n That thou hast practised on her with foul charms, \\n Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals \\n That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on; \\n 'Tis probable and palpable to thinking. \\n I therefore apprehend and do attach thee \\n For an abuser of the world, a practiser \\n Of arts inhibited and out of warrant. \\n Lay hold upon him: if he do resist, \\n Subdue him at his peril. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Hold your hands, \\n Both you of my inclining, and the rest: \\n Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it \\n Without a prompter. Where will you that I go \\n To answer this your charge? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n To prison, till fit time \\n Of law and course of direct session \\n Call thee to answer. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What if I do obey? \\n How may the duke be therewith satisfied, \\n Whose messengers are here about my side, \\n Upon some present business of the state \\n To bring me to him? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Officer \\n 'Tis true, most worthy signior; \\n The duke's in council and your noble self, \\n I am sure, is sent for. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n How! the duke in council! \\n In this time of the night! Bring him away: \\n Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself, \\n Or any of my brothers of the state, \\n Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own; \\n For if such actions may have passage free, \\n Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A council-chamber. \\n The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers\\nattending \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n There is no composition in these news \\n That gives them credit. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n Indeed, they are disproportion'd; \\n My letters say a hundred and seven galleys. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n And mine, a hundred and forty. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Senator \\n And mine, two hundred: \\n But though they jump not on a just account,-- \\n As in these cases, where the aim reports, \\n 'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm \\n A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Nay, it is possible enough to judgment: \\n I do not so secure me in the error, \\n But the main article I do approve \\n In fearful sense. \\n \\n\\n \\n Sailor \\n Within   What, ho! what, ho! what, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n First Officer \\n A messenger from the galleys. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Sailor \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Now, what's the business? \\n \\n\\n \\n Sailor \\n The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes; \\n So was I bid report here to the state \\n By Signior Angelo. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n How say you by this change? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n This cannot be, \\n By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant, \\n To keep us in false gaze. When we consider \\n The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, \\n And let ourselves again but understand, \\n That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes, \\n So may he with more facile question bear it, \\n For that it stands not in such warlike brace, \\n But altogether lacks the abilities \\n That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this, \\n We must not think the Turk is so unskilful \\n To leave that latest which concerns him first, \\n Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain, \\n To wake and wage a danger profitless. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Officer \\n Here is more news. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Messenger \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, \\n Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes, \\n Have there injointed them with an after fleet. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess? \\n \\n\\n \\n Messenger \\n Of thirty sail: and now they do restem \\n Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance \\n Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, \\n Your trusty and most valiant servitor, \\n With his free duty recommends you thus, \\n And prays you to believe him. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n 'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus. \\n Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n He's now in Florence. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you \\n Against the general enemy Ottoman. \\n To BRABANTIO \\n I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior; \\n We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me; \\n Neither my place nor aught I heard of business \\n Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care \\n Take hold on me, for my particular grief \\n Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature \\n That it engluts and swallows other sorrows \\n And it is still itself. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Why, what's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n My daughter! O, my daughter! \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Senator \\n Dead? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Ay, to me; \\n She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted \\n By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks; \\n For nature so preposterously to err, \\n Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, \\n Sans witchcraft could not. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding \\n Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself \\n And you of her, the bloody book of law \\n You shall yourself read in the bitter letter \\n After your own sense, yea, though our proper son \\n Stood in your action. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Humbly I thank your grace. \\n Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems, \\n Your special mandate for the state-affairs \\n Hath hither brought. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Senator \\n We are very sorry for't. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n To OTHELLO   What, in your own part, can you say to this? \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Nothing, but this is so. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, \\n My very noble and approved good masters, \\n That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, \\n It is most true; true, I have married her: \\n The very head and front of my offending \\n Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, \\n And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace: \\n For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, \\n Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used \\n Their dearest action in the tented field, \\n And little of this great world can I speak, \\n More than pertains to feats of broil and battle, \\n And therefore little shall I grace my cause \\n In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, \\n I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver \\n Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms, \\n What conjuration and what mighty magic, \\n For such proceeding I am charged withal, \\n I won his daughter. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n A maiden never bold; \\n Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion \\n Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature, \\n Of years, of country, credit, every thing, \\n To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on! \\n It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect \\n That will confess perfection so could err \\n Against all rules of nature, and must be driven \\n To find out practises of cunning hell, \\n Why this should be. I therefore vouch again \\n That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, \\n Or with some dram conjured to this effect, \\n He wrought upon her. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n To vouch this, is no proof, \\n Without more wider and more overt test \\n Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods \\n Of modern seeming do prefer against him. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n But, Othello, speak: \\n Did you by indirect and forced courses \\n Subdue and poison this young maid's affections? \\n Or came it by request and such fair question \\n As soul to soul affordeth? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I do beseech you, \\n Send for the lady to the Sagittary, \\n And let her speak of me before her father: \\n If you do find me foul in her report, \\n The trust, the office I do hold of you, \\n Not only take away, but let your sentence \\n Even fall upon my life. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Fetch Desdemona hither. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place. \\n Exeunt IAGO and Attendants \\n And, till she come, as truly as to heaven \\n I do confess the vices of my blood, \\n So justly to your grave ears I'll present \\n How I did thrive in this fair lady's love, \\n And she in mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Say it, Othello. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Her father loved me; oft invited me; \\n Still question'd me the story of my life, \\n From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, \\n That I have passed. \\n I ran it through, even from my boyish days, \\n To the very moment that he bade me tell it; \\n Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, \\n Of moving accidents by flood and field \\n Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach, \\n Of being taken by the insolent foe \\n And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence \\n And portance in my travels' history: \\n Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, \\n Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven \\n It was my hint to speak,--such was the process; \\n And of the Cannibals that each other eat, \\n The Anthropophagi and men whose heads \\n Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear \\n Would Desdemona seriously incline: \\n But still the house-affairs would draw her thence: \\n Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, \\n She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear \\n Devour up my discourse: which I observing, \\n Took once a pliant hour, and found good means \\n To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart \\n That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, \\n Whereof by parcels she had something heard, \\n But not intentively: I did consent, \\n And often did beguile her of her tears, \\n When I did speak of some distressful stroke \\n That my youth suffer'd. My story being done, \\n She gave me for my pains a world of sighs: \\n She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange, \\n 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful: \\n She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd \\n That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me, \\n And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, \\n I should but teach him how to tell my story. \\n And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: \\n She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd, \\n And I loved her that she did pity them. \\n This only is the witchcraft I have used: \\n Here comes the lady; let her witness it. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n I think this tale would win my daughter too. \\n Good Brabantio, \\n Take up this mangled matter at the best: \\n Men do their broken weapons rather use \\n Than their bare hands. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n I pray you, hear her speak: \\n If she confess that she was half the wooer, \\n Destruction on my head, if my bad blame \\n Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress: \\n Do you perceive in all this noble company \\n Where most you owe obedience? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My noble father, \\n I do perceive here a divided duty: \\n To you I am bound for life and education; \\n My life and education both do learn me \\n How to respect you; you are the lord of duty; \\n I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband, \\n And so much duty as my mother show'd \\n To you, preferring you before her father, \\n So much I challenge that I may profess \\n Due to the Moor my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n God be wi' you! I have done. \\n Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs: \\n I had rather to adopt a child than get it. \\n Come hither, Moor: \\n I here do give thee that with all my heart \\n Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart \\n I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, \\n I am glad at soul I have no other child: \\n For thy escape would teach me tyranny, \\n To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence, \\n Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers \\n Into your favour. \\n When remedies are past, the griefs are ended \\n By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. \\n To mourn a mischief that is past and gone \\n Is the next way to draw new mischief on. \\n What cannot be preserved when fortune takes \\n Patience her injury a mockery makes. \\n The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; \\n He robs himself that spends a bootless grief. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; \\n We lose it not, so long as we can smile. \\n He bears the sentence well that nothing bears \\n But the free comfort which from thence he hears, \\n But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow \\n That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. \\n These sentences, to sugar, or to gall, \\n Being strong on both sides, are equivocal: \\n But words are words; I never yet did hear \\n That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. \\n I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for \\n Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best \\n known to you; and though we have there a substitute \\n of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a \\n sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer \\n voice on you: you must therefore be content to \\n slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this \\n more stubborn and boisterous expedition. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n The tyrant custom, most grave senators, \\n Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war \\n My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise \\n A natural and prompt alacrity \\n I find in hardness, and do undertake \\n These present wars against the Ottomites. \\n Most humbly therefore bending to your state, \\n I crave fit disposition for my wife. \\n Due reference of place and exhibition, \\n With such accommodation and besort \\n As levels with her breeding. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n If you please, \\n Be't at her father's. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n I'll not have it so. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Nor I. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Nor I; I would not there reside, \\n To put my father in impatient thoughts \\n By being in his eye. Most gracious duke, \\n To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear; \\n And let me find a charter in your voice, \\n To assist my simpleness. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n What would You, Desdemona? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n That I did love the Moor to live with him, \\n My downright violence and storm of fortunes \\n May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued \\n Even to the very quality of my lord: \\n I saw Othello's visage in his mind, \\n And to his honour and his valiant parts \\n Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. \\n So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, \\n A moth of peace, and he go to the war, \\n The rites for which I love him are bereft me, \\n And I a heavy interim shall support \\n By his dear absence. Let me go with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Let her have your voices. \\n Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not, \\n To please the palate of my appetite, \\n Nor to comply with heat--the young affects \\n In me defunct--and proper satisfaction. \\n But to be free and bounteous to her mind: \\n And heaven defend your good souls, that you think \\n I will your serious and great business scant \\n For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys \\n Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness \\n My speculative and officed instruments, \\n That my disports corrupt and taint my business, \\n Let housewives make a skillet of my helm, \\n And all indign and base adversities \\n Make head against my estimation! \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Be it as you shall privately determine, \\n Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste, \\n And speed must answer it. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n You must away to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n With all my heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again. \\n Othello, leave some officer behind, \\n And he shall our commission bring to you; \\n With such things else of quality and respect \\n As doth import you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n So please your grace, my ancient; \\n A man he is of honest and trust: \\n To his conveyance I assign my wife, \\n With what else needful your good grace shall think \\n To be sent after me. \\n \\n\\n \\n DUKE OF VENICE \\n Let it be so. \\n Good night to every one. \\n To BRABANTIO \\n And, noble signior, \\n If virtue no delighted beauty lack, \\n Your son-in-law is far more fair than black. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Senator \\n Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well. \\n \\n\\n \\n BRABANTIO \\n Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see: \\n She has deceived her father, and may thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, &c \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, \\n My Desdemona must I leave to thee: \\n I prithee, let thy wife attend on her: \\n And bring them after in the best advantage. \\n Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour \\n Of love, of worldly matters and direction, \\n To spend with thee: we must obey the time. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Iago,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What say'st thou, noble heart? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n What will I do, thinkest thou? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, go to bed, and sleep. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I will incontinently drown myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, \\n thou silly gentleman! \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and \\n then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four \\n times seven years; and since I could distinguish \\n betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man \\n that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I \\n would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I \\n would change my humanity with a baboon. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so \\n fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus \\n or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which \\n our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant \\n nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up \\n thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or \\n distract it with many, either to have it sterile \\n with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the \\n power and corrigible authority of this lies in our \\n wills. If the balance of our lives had not one \\n scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the \\n blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us \\n to most preposterous conclusions: but we have \\n reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal \\n stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that \\n you call love to be a sect or scion. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n It cannot be. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of \\n the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown \\n cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy \\n friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with \\n cables of perdurable toughness; I could never \\n better stead thee than now. Put money in thy \\n purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with \\n an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It \\n cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her \\n love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he \\n his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou \\n shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but \\n money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in \\n their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food \\n that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be \\n to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must \\n change for youth: when she is sated with his body, \\n she will find the error of her choice: she must \\n have change, she must: therefore put money in thy \\n purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a \\n more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money \\n thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt \\n an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not \\n too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou \\n shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of \\n drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek \\n thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than \\n to be drowned and go without her. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on \\n the issue? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told \\n thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I \\n hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no \\n less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge \\n against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost \\n thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many \\n events in the womb of time which will be delivered. \\n Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more \\n of this to-morrow. Adieu. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Where shall we meet i' the morning? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n At my lodging. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I'll be with thee betimes. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n What say you? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n No more of drowning, do you hear? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I am changed: I'll go sell all my land. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Thus do I ever make my fool my purse: \\n For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane, \\n If I would time expend with such a snipe. \\n But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor: \\n And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets \\n He has done my office: I know not if't be true; \\n But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, \\n Will do as if for surety. He holds me well; \\n The better shall my purpose work on him. \\n Cassio's a proper man: let me see now: \\n To get his place and to plume up my will \\n In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:-- \\n After some time, to abuse Othello's ear \\n That he is too familiar with his wife. \\n He hath a person and a smooth dispose \\n To be suspected, framed to make women false. \\n The Moor is of a free and open nature, \\n That thinks men honest that but seem to be so, \\n And will as tenderly be led by the nose \\n As asses are. \\n I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night \\n Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT II \\n\\n SCENE I.  A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay. \\n Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n What from the cape can you discern at sea? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Gentleman \\n Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood; \\n I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main, \\n Descry a sail. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land; \\n A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements: \\n If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea, \\n What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, \\n Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Gentleman \\n A segregation of the Turkish fleet: \\n For do but stand upon the foaming shore, \\n The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds; \\n The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, \\n seems to cast water on the burning bear, \\n And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole: \\n I never did like molestation view \\n On the enchafed flood. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n If that the Turkish fleet \\n Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd: \\n It is impossible they bear it out. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a third Gentleman \\n\\n \\n Third Gentleman \\n News, lads! our wars are done. \\n The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks, \\n That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice \\n Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance \\n On most part of their fleet. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n How! is this true? \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Gentleman \\n The ship is here put in, \\n A Veronesa; Michael Cassio, \\n Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, \\n Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea, \\n And is in full commission here for Cyprus. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Gentleman \\n But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort \\n Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly, \\n And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted \\n With foul and violent tempest. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n Pray heavens he be; \\n For I have served him, and the man commands \\n Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho! \\n As well to see the vessel that's come in \\n As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, \\n Even till we make the main and the aerial blue \\n An indistinct regard. \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Gentleman \\n Come, let's do so: \\n For every minute is expectancy \\n Of more arrivance. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CASSIO \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle, \\n That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens \\n Give him defence against the elements, \\n For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n Is he well shipp'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot \\n Of very expert and approved allowance; \\n Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, \\n Stand in bold cure. \\n \\n\\n A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!' \\n Enter a fourth Gentleman \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n What noise? \\n \\n\\n \\n Fourth Gentleman \\n The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea \\n Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!' \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n My hopes do shape him for the governor. \\n \\n\\n\\n Guns heard \\n\\n \\n Second Gentlemen \\n They do discharge their shot of courtesy: \\n Our friends at least. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I pray you, sir, go forth, \\n And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Gentleman \\n I shall. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n But, good lieutenant, is your general wived? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid \\n That paragons description and wild fame; \\n One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens, \\n And in the essential vesture of creation \\n Does tire the ingener. \\n Re-enter second Gentleman \\n How now! who has put in? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Gentleman \\n 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Has had most favourable and happy speed: \\n Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, \\n The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands-- \\n Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,-- \\n As having sense of beauty, do omit \\n Their mortal natures, letting go safely by \\n The divine Desdemona. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n What is she? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n She that I spake of, our great captain's captain, \\n Left in the conduct of the bold Iago, \\n Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts \\n A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard, \\n And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, \\n That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, \\n Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, \\n Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits \\n And bring all Cyprus comfort! \\n Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and\\nAttendants \\n O, behold, \\n The riches of the ship is come on shore! \\n Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees. \\n Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven, \\n Before, behind thee, and on every hand, \\n Enwheel thee round! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I thank you, valiant Cassio. \\n What tidings can you tell me of my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught \\n But that he's well and will be shortly here. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O, but I fear--How lost you company? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n The great contention of the sea and skies \\n Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail. \\n \\n\\n\\n Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard \\n\\n \\n Second Gentleman \\n They give their greeting to the citadel; \\n This likewise is a friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n See for the news. \\n Exit Gentleman \\n Good ancient, you are welcome. \\n To EMILIA \\n Welcome, mistress. \\n Let it not gall your patience, good Iago, \\n That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding \\n That gives me this bold show of courtesy. \\n \\n\\n\\n Kissing her \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Sir, would she give you so much of her lips \\n As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, \\n You'll have enough. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Alas, she has no speech. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n In faith, too much; \\n I find it still, when I have list to sleep: \\n Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, \\n She puts her tongue a little in her heart, \\n And chides with thinking. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n You have little cause to say so. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors, \\n Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, \\n Saints m your injuries, devils being offended, \\n Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O, fie upon thee, slanderer! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk: \\n You rise to play and go to bed to work. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n You shall not write my praise. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n No, let me not. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst \\n praise me? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O gentle lady, do not put me to't; \\n For I am nothing, if not critical. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Ay, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I am not merry; but I do beguile \\n The thing I am, by seeming otherwise. \\n Come, how wouldst thou praise me? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I am about it; but indeed my invention \\n Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize; \\n It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours, \\n And thus she is deliver'd. \\n If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, \\n The one's for use, the other useth it. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Well praised! How if she be black and witty? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n If she be black, and thereto have a wit, \\n She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Worse and worse. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n How if fair and foolish? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n She never yet was foolish that was fair; \\n For even her folly help'd her to an heir. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' \\n the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for \\n her that's foul and foolish? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n There's none so foul and foolish thereunto, \\n But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best. \\n But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving \\n woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her \\n merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n She that was ever fair and never proud, \\n Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, \\n Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay, \\n Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,' \\n She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh, \\n Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, \\n She that in wisdom never was so frail \\n To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail; \\n She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, \\n See suitors following and not look behind, \\n She was a wight, if ever such wight were,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n To do what? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n To suckle fools and chronicle small beer. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn \\n of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say \\n you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal \\n counsellor? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in \\n the soldier than in the scholar. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Aside   He takes her by the palm: ay, well said, \\n whisper: with as little a web as this will I \\n ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon \\n her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. \\n You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as \\n these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had \\n been better you had not kissed your three fingers so \\n oft, which now again you are most apt to play the \\n sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent \\n courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers \\n to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! \\n Trumpet within \\n The Moor! I know his trumpet. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n 'Tis truly so. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Let's meet him and receive him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Lo, where he comes! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter OTHELLO and Attendants \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O my fair warrior! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My dear Othello! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n It gives me wonder great as my content \\n To see you here before me. O my soul's joy! \\n If after every tempest come such calms, \\n May the winds blow till they have waken'd death! \\n And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas \\n Olympus-high and duck again as low \\n As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die, \\n 'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear, \\n My soul hath her content so absolute \\n That not another comfort like to this \\n Succeeds in unknown fate. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n The heavens forbid \\n But that our loves and comforts should increase, \\n Even as our days do grow! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Amen to that, sweet powers! \\n I cannot speak enough of this content; \\n It stops me here; it is too much of joy: \\n And this, and this, the greatest discords be \\n Kissing her \\n That e'er our hearts shall make! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Aside   O, you are well tuned now! \\n But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, \\n As honest as I am. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Come, let us to the castle. \\n News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks \\n are drown'd. \\n How does my old acquaintance of this isle? \\n Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus; \\n I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet, \\n I prattle out of fashion, and I dote \\n In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago, \\n Go to the bay and disembark my coffers: \\n Bring thou the master to the citadel; \\n He is a good one, and his worthiness \\n Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona, \\n Once more, well met at Cyprus. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come \\n hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base \\n men being in love have then a nobility in their \\n natures more than is native to them--list me. The \\n lieutenant tonight watches on the court of \\n guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is \\n directly in love with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n With him! why, 'tis not possible. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. \\n Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, \\n but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies: \\n and will she love him still for prating? let not \\n thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; \\n and what delight shall she have to look on the \\n devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of \\n sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to \\n give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, \\n sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which \\n the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these \\n required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will \\n find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, \\n disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will \\n instruct her in it and compel her to some second \\n choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most \\n pregnant and unforced position--who stands so \\n eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio \\n does? a knave very voluble; no further \\n conscionable than in putting on the mere form of \\n civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing \\n of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, \\n none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a \\n finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and \\n counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never \\n present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the \\n knave is handsome, young, and hath all those \\n requisites in him that folly and green minds look \\n after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman \\n hath found him already. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I cannot believe that in her; she's full of \\n most blessed condition. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of \\n grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never \\n have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou \\n not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst \\n not mark that? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue \\n to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met \\n so near with their lips that their breaths embraced \\n together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these \\n mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes \\n the master and main exercise, the incorporate \\n conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I \\n have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; \\n for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows \\n you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find \\n some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking \\n too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what \\n other course you please, which the time shall more \\n favourably minister. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Well. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply \\n may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for \\n even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to \\n mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true \\n taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So \\n shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by \\n the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the \\n impediment most profitably removed, without the \\n which there were no expectation of our prosperity. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I will do this, if I can bring it to any \\n opportunity. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: \\n I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Adieu. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it; \\n That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit: \\n The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, \\n Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, \\n And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona \\n A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too; \\n Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure \\n I stand accountant for as great a sin, \\n But partly led to diet my revenge, \\n For that I do suspect the lusty Moor \\n Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof \\n Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards; \\n And nothing can or shall content my soul \\n Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife, \\n Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor \\n At least into a jealousy so strong \\n That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, \\n If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash \\n For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, \\n I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, \\n Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb-- \\n For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too-- \\n Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me. \\n For making him egregiously an ass \\n And practising upon his peace and quiet \\n Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused: \\n Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A street. \\n Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People\\nfollowing \\n\\n \\n Herald \\n It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant \\n general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived, \\n importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet, \\n every man put himself into triumph; some to dance, \\n some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and \\n revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these \\n beneficial news, it is the celebration of his \\n nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be \\n proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full \\n liberty of feasting from this present hour of five \\n till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the \\n isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A hall in the castle. \\n Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night: \\n Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop, \\n Not to outsport discretion. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Iago hath direction what to do; \\n But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye \\n Will I look to't. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Iago is most honest. \\n Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest \\n Let me have speech with you. \\n To DESDEMONA \\n Come, my dear love, \\n The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; \\n That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you. \\n Good night. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants \\n Enter IAGO \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the \\n clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love \\n of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame: \\n he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and \\n she is sport for Jove. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n She's a most exquisite lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And, I'll warrant her, fun of game. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of \\n provocation. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n She is indeed perfection. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I \\n have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace \\n of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to \\n the health of black Othello. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and \\n unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish \\n courtesy would invent some other custom of \\n entertainment. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for \\n you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was \\n craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation \\n it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity, \\n and dare not task my weakness with any more. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants \\n desire it. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Where are they? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Here at the door; I pray you, call them in. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I'll do't; but it dislikes me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n If I can fasten but one cup upon him, \\n With that which he hath drunk to-night already, \\n He'll be as full of quarrel and offence \\n As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo, \\n Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out, \\n To Desdemona hath to-night caroused \\n Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch: \\n Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits, \\n That hold their honours in a wary distance, \\n The very elements of this warlike isle, \\n Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups, \\n And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards, \\n Am I to put our Cassio in some action \\n That may offend the isle.--But here they come: \\n If consequence do but approve my dream, \\n My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen;\\nservants following with wine \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am \\n a soldier. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Some wine, ho! \\n Sings \\n And let me the canakin clink, clink; \\n And let me the canakin clink \\n A soldier's a man; \\n A life's but a span; \\n Why, then, let a soldier drink. \\n Some wine, boys! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n 'Fore God, an excellent song. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are \\n most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and \\n your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing \\n to your English. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead \\n drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he \\n gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle \\n can be filled. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n To the health of our general! \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O sweet England! \\n King Stephen was a worthy peer, \\n His breeches cost him but a crown; \\n He held them sixpence all too dear, \\n With that he call'd the tailor lown. \\n He was a wight of high renown, \\n And thou art but of low degree: \\n 'Tis pride that pulls the country down; \\n Then take thine auld cloak about thee. \\n Some wine, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Will you hear't again? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that \\n does those things. Well, God's above all; and there \\n be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n It's true, good lieutenant. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor \\n any man of quality,--I hope to be saved. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And so do I too, lieutenant. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the \\n lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's \\n have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive \\n us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business. \\n Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my \\n ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left: \\n I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and \\n speak well enough. \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n Excellent well. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You see this fellow that is gone before; \\n He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar \\n And give direction: and do but see his vice; \\n 'Tis to his virtue a just equinox, \\n The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him. \\n I fear the trust Othello puts him in. \\n On some odd time of his infirmity, \\n Will shake this island. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n But is he often thus? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep: \\n He'll watch the horologe a double set, \\n If drink rock not his cradle. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n It were well \\n The general were put in mind of it. \\n Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature \\n Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio, \\n And looks not on his evils: is not this true? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter RODERIGO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Aside to him   How now, Roderigo! \\n I pray you, after the lieutenant; go. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit RODERIGO \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor \\n Should hazard such a place as his own second \\n With one of an ingraft infirmity: \\n It were an honest action to say \\n So to the Moor. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Not I, for this fair island: \\n I do love Cassio well; and would do much \\n To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise? \\n \\n\\n Cry within: 'Help! help!' \\n Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n You rogue! you rascal! \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n What's the matter, lieutenant? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n A knave teach me my duty! \\n I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Beat me! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Dost thou prate, rogue? \\n \\n\\n\\n Striking RODERIGO \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n Nay, good lieutenant; \\n Staying him \\n I pray you, sir, hold your hand. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Let me go, sir, \\n Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n Come, come, \\n you're drunk. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Drunk! \\n \\n\\n\\n They fight \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Aside to RODERIGO   Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny. \\n Exit RODERIGO \\n Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;-- \\n Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir; \\n Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed! \\n Bell rings \\n Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho! \\n The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold! \\n You will be shamed for ever. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What is the matter here? \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death. \\n \\n\\n\\n Faints \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Hold, for your lives! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,-- \\n Have you forgot all sense of place and duty? \\n Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this? \\n Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that \\n Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites? \\n For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl: \\n He that stirs next to carve for his own rage \\n Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion. \\n Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle \\n From her propriety. What is the matter, masters? \\n Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving, \\n Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I do not know: friends all but now, even now, \\n In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom \\n Devesting them for bed; and then, but now-- \\n As if some planet had unwitted men-- \\n Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast, \\n In opposition bloody. I cannot speak \\n Any beginning to this peevish odds; \\n And would in action glorious I had lost \\n Those legs that brought me to a part of it! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil; \\n The gravity and stillness of your youth \\n The world hath noted, and your name is great \\n In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter, \\n That you unlace your reputation thus \\n And spend your rich opinion for the name \\n Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger: \\n Your officer, Iago, can inform you,-- \\n While I spare speech, which something now \\n offends me,-- \\n Of all that I do know: nor know I aught \\n By me that's said or done amiss this night; \\n Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, \\n And to defend ourselves it be a sin \\n When violence assails us. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Now, by heaven, \\n My blood begins my safer guides to rule; \\n And passion, having my best judgment collied, \\n Assays to lead the way: if I once stir, \\n Or do but lift this arm, the best of you \\n Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know \\n How this foul rout began, who set it on; \\n And he that is approved in this offence, \\n Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth, \\n Shall lose me. What! in a town of war, \\n Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, \\n To manage private and domestic quarrel, \\n In night, and on the court and guard of safety! \\n 'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't? \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n If partially affined, or leagued in office, \\n Thou dost deliver more or less than truth, \\n Thou art no soldier. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Touch me not so near: \\n I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth \\n Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio; \\n Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth \\n Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general. \\n Montano and myself being in speech, \\n There comes a fellow crying out for help: \\n And Cassio following him with determined sword, \\n To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman \\n Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause: \\n Myself the crying fellow did pursue, \\n Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out-- \\n The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot, \\n Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather \\n For that I heard the clink and fall of swords, \\n And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night \\n I ne'er might say before. When I came back-- \\n For this was brief--I found them close together, \\n At blow and thrust; even as again they were \\n When you yourself did part them. \\n More of this matter cannot I report: \\n But men are men; the best sometimes forget: \\n Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, \\n As men in rage strike those that wish them best, \\n Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received \\n From him that fled some strange indignity, \\n Which patience could not pass. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I know, Iago, \\n Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, \\n Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee \\n But never more be officer of mine. \\n Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended \\n Look, if my gentle love be not raised up! \\n I'll make thee an example. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n What's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed. \\n Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon: \\n Lead him off. \\n To MONTANO, who is led off \\n Iago, look with care about the town, \\n And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted. \\n Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life \\n To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What, are you hurt, lieutenant? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Ay, past all surgery. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Marry, heaven forbid! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost \\n my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of \\n myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, \\n Iago, my reputation! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n As I am an honest man, I thought you had received \\n some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than \\n in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false \\n imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without \\n deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, \\n unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! \\n there are ways to recover the general again: you \\n are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in \\n policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his \\n offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue \\n to him again, and he's yours. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so \\n good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so \\n indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? \\n and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse \\n fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible \\n spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, \\n let us call thee devil! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What was he that you followed with your sword? What \\n had he done to you? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I know not. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Is't possible? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; \\n a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men \\n should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away \\n their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance \\n revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus \\n recovered? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place \\n to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me \\n another, to make me frankly despise myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time, \\n the place, and the condition of this country \\n stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; \\n but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me \\n I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, \\n such an answer would stop them all. To be now a \\n sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a \\n beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is \\n unblessed and the ingredient is a devil. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, \\n if it be well used: exclaim no more against it. \\n And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I have well approved it, sir. I drunk! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man. \\n I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife \\n is now the general: may say so in this respect, for \\n that he hath devoted and given up himself to the \\n contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and \\n graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune \\n her help to put you in your place again: she is of \\n so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, \\n she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more \\n than she is requested: this broken joint between \\n you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my \\n fortunes against any lay worth naming, this \\n crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n You advise me well. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will \\n beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me: \\n I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I \\n must to the watch. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Good night, honest Iago. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And what's he then that says I play the villain? \\n When this advice is free I give and honest, \\n Probal to thinking and indeed the course \\n To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy \\n The inclining Desdemona to subdue \\n In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful \\n As the free elements. And then for her \\n To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism, \\n All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, \\n His soul is so enfetter'd to her love, \\n That she may make, unmake, do what she list, \\n Even as her appetite shall play the god \\n With his weak function. How am I then a villain \\n To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, \\n Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! \\n When devils will the blackest sins put on, \\n They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, \\n As I do now: for whiles this honest fool \\n Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes \\n And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, \\n I'll pour this pestilence into his ear, \\n That she repeals him for her body's lust; \\n And by how much she strives to do him good, \\n She shall undo her credit with the Moor. \\n So will I turn her virtue into pitch, \\n And out of her own goodness make the net \\n That shall enmesh them all. \\n Re-enter RODERIGO \\n How now, Roderigo! \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that \\n hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is \\n almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well \\n cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall \\n have so much experience for my pains, and so, with \\n no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n How poor are they that have not patience! \\n What wound did ever heal but by degrees? \\n Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft; \\n And wit depends on dilatory time. \\n Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee. \\n And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio: \\n Though other things grow fair against the sun, \\n Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe: \\n Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning; \\n Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. \\n Retire thee; go where thou art billeted: \\n Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter: \\n Nay, get thee gone. \\n Exit RODERIGO \\n Two things are to be done: \\n My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress; \\n I'll set her on; \\n Myself the while to draw the Moor apart, \\n And bring him jump when he may Cassio find \\n Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way \\n Dull not device by coldness and delay. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.  Before the castle. \\n Enter CASSIO and some Musicians \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Masters, play here; I will content your pains; \\n Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.' \\n \\n\\n Music \\n Enter Clown \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, \\n that they speak i' the nose thus? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n How, sir, how! \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Ay, marry, are they, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n O, thereby hangs a tail. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Whereby hangs a tale, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know. \\n But, masters, here's money for you: and the general \\n so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's \\n sake, to make no more noise with it. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Well, sir, we will not. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n If you have any music that may not be heard, to't \\n again: but, as they say to hear music the general \\n does not greatly care. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n We have none such, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away: \\n go; vanish into air; away! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt Musicians \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Dost thou hear, my honest friend? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece \\n of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends \\n the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's \\n one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech: \\n wilt thou do this? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I \\n shall seem to notify unto her. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Do, good my friend. \\n Exit Clown \\n Enter IAGO \\n In happy time, Iago. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You have not been a-bed, then? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Why, no; the day had broke \\n Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago, \\n To send in to your wife: my suit to her \\n Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona \\n Procure me some access. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I'll send her to you presently; \\n And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor \\n Out of the way, that your converse and business \\n May be more free. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I humbly thank you for't. \\n Exit IAGO \\n I never knew \\n A Florentine more kind and honest. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter EMILIA \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry \\n For your displeasure; but all will sure be well. \\n The general and his wife are talking of it; \\n And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies, \\n That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus, \\n And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom \\n He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you \\n And needs no other suitor but his likings \\n To take the safest occasion by the front \\n To bring you in again. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Yet, I beseech you, \\n If you think fit, or that it may be done, \\n Give me advantage of some brief discourse \\n With Desdemona alone. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Pray you, come in; \\n I will bestow you where you shall have time \\n To speak your bosom freely. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I am much bound to you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A room in the castle. \\n Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n These letters give, Iago, to the pilot; \\n And by him do my duties to the senate: \\n That done, I will be walking on the works; \\n Repair there to me. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Well, my good lord, I'll do't. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't? \\n \\n\\n \\n Gentleman \\n We'll wait upon your lordship. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  The garden of the castle. \\n Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do \\n All my abilities in thy behalf. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband, \\n As if the case were his. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio, \\n But I will have my lord and you again \\n As friendly as you were. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Bounteous madam, \\n Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, \\n He's never any thing but your true servant. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord: \\n You have known him long; and be you well assured \\n He shall in strangeness stand no further off \\n Than in a polite distance. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Ay, but, lady, \\n That policy may either last so long, \\n Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, \\n Or breed itself so out of circumstance, \\n That, I being absent and my place supplied, \\n My general will forget my love and service. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Do not doubt that; before Emilia here \\n I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee, \\n If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it \\n To the last article: my lord shall never rest; \\n I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; \\n His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; \\n I'll intermingle every thing he does \\n With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio; \\n For thy solicitor shall rather die \\n Than give thy cause away. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Madam, here comes my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Madam, I'll take my leave. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why, stay, and hear me speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease, \\n Unfit for mine own purposes. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Well, do your discretion. \\n \\n\\n Exit CASSIO \\n Enter OTHELLO and IAGO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Ha! I like not that. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What dost thou say? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Was not that Cassio parted from my wife? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it, \\n That he would steal away so guilty-like, \\n Seeing you coming. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I do believe 'twas he. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n How now, my lord! \\n I have been talking with a suitor here, \\n A man that languishes in your displeasure. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Who is't you mean? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, \\n If I have any grace or power to move you, \\n His present reconciliation take; \\n For if he be not one that truly loves you, \\n That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, \\n I have no judgment in an honest face: \\n I prithee, call him back. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Went he hence now? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Ay, sooth; so humbled \\n That he hath left part of his grief with me, \\n To suffer with him. Good love, call him back. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n But shall't be shortly? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n The sooner, sweet, for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Shall't be to-night at supper? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n No, not to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n To-morrow dinner, then? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I shall not dine at home; \\n I meet the captains at the citadel. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; \\n On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn: \\n I prithee, name the time, but let it not \\n Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent; \\n And yet his trespass, in our common reason-- \\n Save that, they say, the wars must make examples \\n Out of their best--is not almost a fault \\n To incur a private cheque. When shall he come? \\n Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul, \\n What you would ask me, that I should deny, \\n Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio, \\n That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time, \\n When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, \\n Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do \\n To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Prithee, no more: let him come when he will; \\n I will deny thee nothing. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why, this is not a boon; \\n 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, \\n Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, \\n Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit \\n To your own person: nay, when I have a suit \\n Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, \\n It shall be full of poise and difficult weight \\n And fearful to be granted. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I will deny thee nothing: \\n Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, \\n To leave me but a little to myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you; \\n Whate'er you be, I am obedient. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul, \\n But I do love thee! and when I love thee not, \\n Chaos is come again. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n My noble lord-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What dost thou say, Iago? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady, \\n Know of your love? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n But for a satisfaction of my thought; \\n No further harm. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Why of thy thought, Iago? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I did not think he had been acquainted with her. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O, yes; and went between us very oft. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Indeed! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that? \\n Is he not honest? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Honest, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Honest! ay, honest. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n My lord, for aught I know. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What dost thou think? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Think, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Think, my lord! \\n By heaven, he echoes me, \\n As if there were some monster in his thought \\n Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something: \\n I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that, \\n When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like? \\n And when I told thee he was of my counsel \\n In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!' \\n And didst contract and purse thy brow together, \\n As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain \\n Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me, \\n Show me thy thought. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n My lord, you know I love you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I think thou dost; \\n And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty, \\n And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath, \\n Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more: \\n For such things in a false disloyal knave \\n Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just \\n They are close delations, working from the heart \\n That passion cannot rule. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n For Michael Cassio, \\n I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I think so too. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Men should be what they seem; \\n Or those that be not, would they might seem none! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Certain, men should be what they seem. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Nay, yet there's more in this: \\n I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, \\n As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts \\n The worst of words. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Good my lord, pardon me: \\n Though I am bound to every act of duty, \\n I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. \\n Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false; \\n As where's that palace whereinto foul things \\n Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure, \\n But some uncleanly apprehensions \\n Keep leets and law-days and in session sit \\n With meditations lawful? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, \\n If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear \\n A stranger to thy thoughts. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I do beseech you-- \\n Though I perchance am vicious in my guess, \\n As, I confess, it is my nature's plague \\n To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy \\n Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet, \\n From one that so imperfectly conceits, \\n Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble \\n Out of his scattering and unsure observance. \\n It were not for your quiet nor your good, \\n Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom, \\n To let you know my thoughts. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What dost thou mean? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, \\n Is the immediate jewel of their souls: \\n Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; \\n 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands: \\n But he that filches from me my good name \\n Robs me of that which not enriches him \\n And makes me poor indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You cannot, if my heart were in your hand; \\n Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ha! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; \\n It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock \\n The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss \\n Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; \\n But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er \\n Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O misery! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Poor and content is rich and rich enough, \\n But riches fineless is as poor as winter \\n To him that ever fears he shall be poor. \\n Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend \\n From jealousy! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Why, why is this? \\n Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy, \\n To follow still the changes of the moon \\n With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt \\n Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat, \\n When I shall turn the business of my soul \\n To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, \\n Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous \\n To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, \\n Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well; \\n Where virtue is, these are more virtuous: \\n Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw \\n The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; \\n For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago; \\n I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; \\n And on the proof, there is no more but this,-- \\n Away at once with love or jealousy! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason \\n To show the love and duty that I bear you \\n With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound, \\n Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. \\n Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; \\n Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure: \\n I would not have your free and noble nature, \\n Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't: \\n I know our country disposition well; \\n In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks \\n They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience \\n Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Dost thou say so? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n She did deceive her father, marrying you; \\n And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks, \\n She loved them most. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n And so she did. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, go to then; \\n She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, \\n To seal her father's eyes up close as oak- \\n He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame; \\n I humbly do beseech you of your pardon \\n For too much loving you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I am bound to thee for ever. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Not a jot, not a jot. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I' faith, I fear it has. \\n I hope you will consider what is spoke \\n Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved: \\n I am to pray you not to strain my speech \\n To grosser issues nor to larger reach \\n Than to suspicion. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I will not. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Should you do so, my lord, \\n My speech should fall into such vile success \\n As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend-- \\n My lord, I see you're moved. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n No, not much moved: \\n I do not think but Desdemona's honest. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Long live she so! and long live you to think so! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n And yet, how nature erring from itself,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you-- \\n Not to affect many proposed matches \\n Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, \\n Whereto we see in all things nature tends-- \\n Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank, \\n Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural. \\n But pardon me; I do not in position \\n Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear \\n Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, \\n May fall to match you with her country forms \\n And happily repent. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Farewell, farewell: \\n If more thou dost perceive, let me know more; \\n Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago: \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Going   My lord, I take my leave. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless \\n Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Returning   My lord, I would I might entreat \\n your honour \\n To scan this thing no further; leave it to time: \\n Though it be fit that Cassio have his place, \\n For sure, he fills it up with great ability, \\n Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, \\n You shall by that perceive him and his means: \\n Note, if your lady strain his entertainment \\n With any strong or vehement importunity; \\n Much will be seen in that. In the mean time, \\n Let me be thought too busy in my fears-- \\n As worthy cause I have to fear I am-- \\n And hold her free, I do beseech your honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Fear not my government. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I once more take my leave. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n This fellow's of exceeding honesty, \\n And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit, \\n Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard, \\n Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, \\n I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind, \\n To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black \\n And have not those soft parts of conversation \\n That chamberers have, or for I am declined \\n Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much-- \\n She's gone. I am abused; and my relief \\n Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage, \\n That we can call these delicate creatures ours, \\n And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad, \\n And live upon the vapour of a dungeon, \\n Than keep a corner in the thing I love \\n For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones; \\n Prerogatived are they less than the base; \\n 'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death: \\n Even then this forked plague is fated to us \\n When we do quicken. Desdemona comes: \\n Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA \\n If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself! \\n I'll not believe't. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n How now, my dear Othello! \\n Your dinner, and the generous islanders \\n By you invited, do attend your presence. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I am to blame. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why do you speak so faintly? \\n Are you not well? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I have a pain upon my forehead here. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n 'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again: \\n Let me but bind it hard, within this hour \\n It will be well. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Your napkin is too little: \\n He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops \\n Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I am very sorry that you are not well. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I am glad I have found this napkin: \\n This was her first remembrance from the Moor: \\n My wayward husband hath a hundred times \\n Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token, \\n For he conjured her she should ever keep it, \\n That she reserves it evermore about her \\n To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out, \\n And give't Iago: what he will do with it \\n Heaven knows, not I; \\n I nothing but to please his fantasy. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter Iago \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n How now! what do you here alone? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Do not you chide; I have a thing for you. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n A thing for me? it is a common thing-- \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Ha! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n To have a foolish wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O, is that all? What will you give me now \\n For the same handkerchief? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What handkerchief? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n What handkerchief? \\n Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona; \\n That which so often you did bid me steal. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Hast stol'n it from her? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence. \\n And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up. \\n Look, here it is. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n A good wench; give it me. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n What will you do with 't, that you have been \\n so earnest \\n To have me filch it? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Snatching it   Why, what's that to you? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n If it be not for some purpose of import, \\n Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad \\n When she shall lack it. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it. \\n Go, leave me. \\n Exit EMILIA \\n I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin, \\n And let him find it. Trifles light as air \\n Are to the jealous confirmations strong \\n As proofs of holy writ: this may do something. \\n The Moor already changes with my poison: \\n Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons. \\n Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, \\n But with a little act upon the blood. \\n Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so: \\n Look, where he comes! \\n Re-enter OTHELLO \\n Not poppy, nor mandragora, \\n Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, \\n Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep \\n Which thou owedst yesterday. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ha! ha! false to me? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, how now, general! no more of that. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack: \\n I swear 'tis better to be much abused \\n Than but to know't a little. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n How now, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust? \\n I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me: \\n I slept the next night well, was free and merry; \\n I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips: \\n He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n, \\n Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I am sorry to hear this. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I had been happy, if the general camp, \\n Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body, \\n So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever \\n Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content! \\n Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars, \\n That make ambition virtue! O, farewell! \\n Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump, \\n The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife, \\n The royal banner, and all quality, \\n Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war! \\n And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats \\n The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit, \\n Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Is't possible, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore, \\n Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof: \\n Or by the worth of man's eternal soul, \\n Thou hadst been better have been born a dog \\n Than answer my waked wrath! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Is't come to this? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it, \\n That the probation bear no hinge nor loop \\n To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n My noble lord,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n If thou dost slander her and torture me, \\n Never pray more; abandon all remorse; \\n On horror's head horrors accumulate; \\n Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed; \\n For nothing canst thou to damnation add \\n Greater than that. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O grace! O heaven forgive me! \\n Are you a man? have you a soul or sense? \\n God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool. \\n That livest to make thine honesty a vice! \\n O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world, \\n To be direct and honest is not safe. \\n I thank you for this profit; and from hence \\n I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I should be wise, for honesty's a fool \\n And loses that it works for. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n By the world, \\n I think my wife be honest and think she is not; \\n I think that thou art just and think thou art not. \\n I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh \\n As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black \\n As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives, \\n Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, \\n I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion: \\n I do repent me that I put it to you. \\n You would be satisfied? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Would! nay, I will. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord? \\n Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on-- \\n Behold her topp'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Death and damnation! O! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n It were a tedious difficulty, I think, \\n To bring them to that prospect: damn them then, \\n If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster \\n More than their own! What then? how then? \\n What shall I say? Where's satisfaction? \\n It is impossible you should see this, \\n Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, \\n As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross \\n As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say, \\n If imputation and strong circumstances, \\n Which lead directly to the door of truth, \\n Will give you satisfaction, you may have't. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Give me a living reason she's disloyal. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I do not like the office: \\n But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far, \\n Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love, \\n I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately; \\n And, being troubled with a raging tooth, \\n I could not sleep. \\n There are a kind of men so loose of soul, \\n That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs: \\n One of this kind is Cassio: \\n In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona, \\n Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;' \\n And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, \\n Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard, \\n As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots \\n That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg \\n Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then \\n Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!' \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O monstrous! monstrous! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Nay, this was but his dream. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n But this denoted a foregone conclusion: \\n 'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And this may help to thicken other proofs \\n That do demonstrate thinly. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I'll tear her all to pieces. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done; \\n She may be honest yet. Tell me but this, \\n Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief \\n Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I know not that; but such a handkerchief-- \\n I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day \\n See Cassio wipe his beard with. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n If it be that-- \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n If it be that, or any that was hers, \\n It speaks against her with the other proofs. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! \\n One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. \\n Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago; \\n All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. \\n 'Tis gone. \\n Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell! \\n Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne \\n To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, \\n For 'tis of aspics' tongues! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Yet be content. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O, blood, blood, blood! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea, \\n Whose icy current and compulsive course \\n Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on \\n To the Propontic and the Hellespont, \\n Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace, \\n Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love, \\n Till that a capable and wide revenge \\n Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven, \\n Kneels \\n In the due reverence of a sacred vow \\n I here engage my words. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Do not rise yet. \\n Kneels \\n Witness, you ever-burning lights above, \\n You elements that clip us round about, \\n Witness that here Iago doth give up \\n The execution of his wit, hands, heart, \\n To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command, \\n And to obey shall be in me remorse, \\n What bloody business ever. \\n \\n\\n\\n They rise \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I greet thy love, \\n Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous, \\n And will upon the instant put thee to't: \\n Within these three days let me hear thee say \\n That Cassio's not alive. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request: \\n But let her live. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! \\n Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw, \\n To furnish me with some swift means of death \\n For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I am your own for ever. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  Before the castle. \\n Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n I dare not say he lies any where. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why, man? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, \\n is stabbing. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Go to: where lodges he? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Can any thing be made of this? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a \\n lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were \\n to lie in mine own throat. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report? \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n I will catechise the world for him; that is, make \\n questions, and by them answer. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have \\n moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well. \\n \\n\\n \\n Clown \\n To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and \\n therefore I will attempt the doing it. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I know not, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse \\n Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor \\n Is true of mind and made of no such baseness \\n As jealous creatures are, it were enough \\n To put him to ill thinking. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Is he not jealous? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Who, he? I think the sun where he was born \\n Drew all such humours from him. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Look, where he comes. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I will not leave him now till Cassio \\n Be call'd to him. \\n Enter OTHELLO \\n How is't with you, my lord \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Well, my good lady. \\n Aside \\n O, hardness to dissemble!-- \\n How do you, Desdemona? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Well, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart: \\n Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires \\n A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer, \\n Much castigation, exercise devout; \\n For here's a young and sweating devil here, \\n That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand, \\n A frank one. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n You may, indeed, say so; \\n For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands; \\n But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What promise, chuck? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me; \\n Lend me thy handkerchief. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Here, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That which I gave you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I have it not about me. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Not? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n No, indeed, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That is a fault. \\n That handkerchief \\n Did an Egyptian to my mother give; \\n She was a charmer, and could almost read \\n The thoughts of people: she told her, while \\n she kept it, \\n 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father \\n Entirely to her love, but if she lost it \\n Or made gift of it, my father's eye \\n Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt \\n After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me; \\n And bid me, when my fate would have me wive, \\n To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't; \\n Make it a darling like your precious eye; \\n To lose't or give't away were such perdition \\n As nothing else could match. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Is't possible? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n 'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it: \\n A sibyl, that had number'd in the world \\n The sun to course two hundred compasses, \\n In her prophetic fury sew'd the work; \\n The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk; \\n And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful \\n Conserved of maidens' hearts. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Indeed! is't true? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Most veritable; therefore look to't well. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Then would to God that I had never seen't! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ha! wherefore? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why do you speak so startingly and rash? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out \\n o' the way? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Heaven bless us! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Say you? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n It is not lost; but what an if it were? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n How! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I say, it is not lost. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Fetch't, let me see't. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now. \\n This is a trick to put me from my suit: \\n Pray you, let Cassio be received again. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Come, come; \\n You'll never meet a more sufficient man. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n The handkerchief! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I pray, talk me of Cassio. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n The handkerchief! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n A man that all his time \\n Hath founded his good fortunes on your love, \\n Shared dangers with you,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n The handkerchief! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n In sooth, you are to blame. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Away! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Is not this man jealous? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I ne'er saw this before. \\n Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief: \\n I am most unhappy in the loss of it. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man: \\n They are all but stomachs, and we all but food; \\n To eat us hungerly, and when they are full, \\n They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CASSIO and IAGO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n There is no other way; 'tis she must do't: \\n And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you \\n That by your virtuous means I may again \\n Exist, and be a member of his love \\n Whom I with all the office of my heart \\n Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd. \\n If my offence be of such mortal kind \\n That nor my service past, nor present sorrows, \\n Nor purposed merit in futurity, \\n Can ransom me into his love again, \\n But to know so must be my benefit; \\n So shall I clothe me in a forced content, \\n And shut myself up in some other course, \\n To fortune's alms. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio! \\n My advocation is not now in tune; \\n My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him, \\n Were he in favour as in humour alter'd. \\n So help me every spirit sanctified, \\n As I have spoken for you all my best \\n And stood within the blank of his displeasure \\n For my free speech! you must awhile be patient: \\n What I can do I will; and more I will \\n Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Is my lord angry? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n He went hence but now, \\n And certainly in strange unquietness. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon, \\n When it hath blown his ranks into the air, \\n And, like the devil, from his very arm \\n Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry? \\n Something of moment then: I will go meet him: \\n There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I prithee, do so. \\n Exit IAGO \\n Something, sure, of state, \\n Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise \\n Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, \\n Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases \\n Men's natures wrangle with inferior things, \\n Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so; \\n For let our finger ache, and it indues \\n Our other healthful members even to that sense \\n Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods, \\n Nor of them look for such observances \\n As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, \\n I was, unhandsome warrior as I am, \\n Arraigning his unkindness with my soul; \\n But now I find I had suborn'd the witness, \\n And he's indicted falsely. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think, \\n And no conception nor no jealous toy \\n Concerning you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Alas the day! I never gave him cause. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n But jealous souls will not be answer'd so; \\n They are not ever jealous for the cause, \\n But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster \\n Begot upon itself, born on itself. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Lady, amen. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout: \\n If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit \\n And seek to effect it to my uttermost. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I humbly thank your ladyship. \\n \\n\\n Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA \\n Enter BIANCA \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n Save you, friend Cassio! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n What make you from home? \\n How is it with you, my most fair Bianca? \\n I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house. \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n And I was going to your lodging, Cassio. \\n What, keep a week away? seven days and nights? \\n Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours, \\n More tedious than the dial eight score times? \\n O weary reckoning! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Pardon me, Bianca: \\n I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd: \\n But I shall, in a more continuate time, \\n Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca, \\n Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief \\n Take me this work out. \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n O Cassio, whence came this? \\n This is some token from a newer friend: \\n To the felt absence now I feel a cause: \\n Is't come to this? Well, well. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Go to, woman! \\n Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth, \\n From whence you have them. You are jealous now \\n That this is from some mistress, some remembrance: \\n No, in good troth, Bianca. \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n Why, whose is it? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber. \\n I like the work well: ere it be demanded-- \\n As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied: \\n Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time. \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n Leave you! wherefore? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I do attend here on the general; \\n And think it no addition, nor my wish, \\n To have him see me woman'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n Why, I pray you? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Not that I love you not. \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n But that you do not love me. \\n I pray you, bring me on the way a little, \\n And say if I shall see you soon at night. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you; \\n For I attend here: but I'll see you soon. \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT IV \\n\\n SCENE I.  Cyprus. Before the castle. \\n Enter OTHELLO and IAGO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Will you think so? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Think so, Iago! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What, \\n To kiss in private? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n An unauthorized kiss. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Or to be naked with her friend in bed \\n An hour or more, not meaning any harm? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm! \\n It is hypocrisy against the devil: \\n They that mean virtuously, and yet do so, \\n The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip: \\n But if I give my wife a handkerchief,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What then? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers, \\n She may, I think, bestow't on any man. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n She is protectress of her honour too: \\n May she give that? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Her honour is an essence that's not seen; \\n They have it very oft that have it not: \\n But, for the handkerchief,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. \\n Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory, \\n As doth the raven o'er the infected house, \\n Boding to all--he had my handkerchief. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Ay, what of that? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That's not so good now. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What, \\n If I had said I had seen him do you wrong? \\n Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad, \\n Who having, by their own importunate suit, \\n Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, \\n Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose \\n But they must blab-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Hath he said any thing? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n He hath, my lord; but be you well assured, \\n No more than he'll unswear. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What hath he said? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What? what? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Lie-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n With her? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n With her, on her; what you will. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when \\n they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome. \\n --Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To \\n confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be \\n hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it. \\n Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing \\n passion without some instruction. It is not words \\n that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. \\n --Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!-- \\n \\n\\n\\n Falls in a trance \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Work on, \\n My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught; \\n And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, \\n All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord! \\n My lord, I say! Othello! \\n Enter CASSIO \\n How now, Cassio! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n What's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy: \\n This is his second fit; he had one yesterday. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Rub him about the temples. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n No, forbear; \\n The lethargy must have his quiet course: \\n If not, he foams at mouth and by and by \\n Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs: \\n Do you withdraw yourself a little while, \\n He will recover straight: when he is gone, \\n I would on great occasion speak with you. \\n Exit CASSIO \\n How is it, general? have you not hurt your head? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Dost thou mock me? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I mock you! no, by heaven. \\n Would you would bear your fortune like a man! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n A horned man's a monster and a beast. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n There's many a beast then in a populous city, \\n And many a civil monster. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Did he confess it? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Good sir, be a man; \\n Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked \\n May draw with you: there's millions now alive \\n That nightly lie in those unproper beds \\n Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better. \\n O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock, \\n To lip a wanton in a secure couch, \\n And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know; \\n And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O, thou art wise; 'tis certain. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Stand you awhile apart; \\n Confine yourself but in a patient list. \\n Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief-- \\n A passion most unsuiting such a man-- \\n Cassio came hither: I shifted him away, \\n And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy, \\n Bade him anon return and here speak with me; \\n The which he promised. Do but encave yourself, \\n And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, \\n That dwell in every region of his face; \\n For I will make him tell the tale anew, \\n Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when \\n He hath, and is again to cope your wife: \\n I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience; \\n Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, \\n And nothing of a man. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Dost thou hear, Iago? \\n I will be found most cunning in my patience; \\n But--dost thou hear?--most bloody. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n That's not amiss; \\n But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw? \\n OTHELLO retires \\n Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, \\n A housewife that by selling her desires \\n Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature \\n That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague \\n To beguile many and be beguiled by one: \\n He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain \\n From the excess of laughter. Here he comes: \\n Re-enter CASSIO \\n As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad; \\n And his unbookish jealousy must construe \\n Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior, \\n Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n The worser that you give me the addition \\n Whose want even kills me. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't. \\n Speaking lower \\n Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power, \\n How quickly should you speed! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Alas, poor caitiff! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Look, how he laughs already! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I never knew woman love man so. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Do you hear, Cassio? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Now he importunes him \\n To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n She gives it out that you shall marry hey: \\n Do you intend it? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Ha, ha, ha! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some \\n charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome. \\n Ha, ha, ha! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n So, so, so, so: they laugh that win. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Prithee, say true. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I am a very villain else. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Have you scored me? Well. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n This is the monkey's own giving out: she is \\n persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and \\n flattery, not out of my promise. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Iago beckons me; now he begins the story. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. \\n I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with \\n certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble, \\n and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture \\n imports it. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales, \\n and pulls me: ha, ha, ha! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, \\n I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall \\n throw it to. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Well, I must leave her company. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Before me! look, where she comes. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n 'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one. \\n Enter BIANCA \\n What do you mean by this haunting of me? \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you \\n mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? \\n I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the \\n work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find \\n it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! \\n This is some minx's token, and I must take out the \\n work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever \\n you had it, I'll take out no work on't. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n By heaven, that should be my handkerchief! \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you \\n will not, come when you are next prepared for. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n After her, after her. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n 'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Will you sup there? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n 'Faith, I intend so. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain \\n speak with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Prithee, come; will you? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Go to; say no more. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit CASSIO \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Advancing   How shall I murder him, Iago? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O Iago! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And did you see the handkerchief? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Was that mine? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the \\n foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he \\n hath given it his whore. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I would have him nine years a-killing. \\n A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Nay, you must forget that. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; \\n for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to \\n stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the \\n world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by \\n an emperor's side and command him tasks. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Nay, that's not your way. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate \\n with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she \\n will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high \\n and plenteous wit and invention:-- \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n She's the worse for all this. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so \\n gentle a condition! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Ay, too gentle. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago! \\n O Iago, the pity of it, Iago! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her \\n patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes \\n near nobody. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I will chop her into messes: cuckold me! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O, 'tis foul in her. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n With mine officer! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n That's fouler. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not \\n expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty \\n unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even \\n the bed she hath contaminated. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you \\n shall hear more by midnight. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Excellent good. \\n A trumpet within \\n What trumpet is that same? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico \\n Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Save you, worthy general! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n With all my heart, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n The duke and senators of Venice greet you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Gives him a letter \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I kiss the instrument of their pleasures. \\n \\n\\n\\n Opens the letter, and reads \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I am very glad to see you, signior \\n Welcome to Cyprus. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Lives, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord \\n An unkind breach: but you shall make all well. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Are you sure of that? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Reads   'This fail you not to do, as you will--' \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n He did not call; he's busy in the paper. \\n Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n A most unhappy one: I would do much \\n To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Fire and brimstone! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Are you wise? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n What, is he angry? \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n May be the letter moved him; \\n For, as I think, they do command him home, \\n Deputing Cassio in his government. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Trust me, I am glad on't. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Indeed! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I am glad to see you mad. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Why, sweet Othello,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Striking her   Devil! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I have not deserved this. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, \\n Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much: \\n Make her amends; she weeps. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O devil, devil! \\n If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, \\n Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile. \\n Out of my sight! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I will not stay to offend you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Going \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Truly, an obedient lady: \\n I do beseech your lordship, call her back. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Mistress! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What would you with her, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Who, I, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn: \\n Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, \\n And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep; \\n And she's obedient, as you say, obedient, \\n Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears. \\n Concerning this, sir,--O  well-painted passion!-- \\n I am commanded home. Get you away; \\n I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, \\n And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt! \\n Exit DESDEMONA \\n Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight, \\n I do entreat that we may sup together: \\n You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate \\n Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature \\n Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue \\n The shot of accident, nor dart of chance, \\n Could neither graze nor pierce? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n He is much changed. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure \\n What he might be: if what he might he is not, \\n I would to heaven he were! \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n What, strike his wife! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew \\n That stroke would prove the worst! \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Is it his use? \\n Or did the letters work upon his blood, \\n And new-create this fault? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Alas, alas! \\n It is not honesty in me to speak \\n What I have seen and known. You shall observe him, \\n And his own courses will denote him so \\n That I may save my speech: do but go after, \\n And mark how he continues. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n I am sorry that I am deceived in him. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A room in the castle. \\n Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n You have seen nothing then? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n But then I saw no harm, and then I heard \\n Each syllable that breath made up between them. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What, did they never whisper? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Never, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Nor send you out o' the way? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Never. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Never, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That's strange. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, \\n Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other, \\n Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom. \\n If any wretch have put this in your head, \\n Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse! \\n For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true, \\n There's no man happy; the purest of their wives \\n Is foul as slander. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Bid her come hither: go. \\n Exit EMILIA \\n She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd \\n That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore, \\n A closet lock and key of villanous secrets \\n And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My lord, what is your will? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Pray, chuck, come hither. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n What is your pleasure? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Let me see your eyes; \\n Look in my face. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n What horrible fancy's this? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n To EMILIA   Some of your function, mistress; \\n Leave procreants alone and shut the door; \\n Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come: \\n Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit EMILIA \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Upon my knees, what doth your speech import? \\n I understand a fury in your words. \\n But not the words. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Why, what art thou? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Your wife, my lord; your true \\n And loyal wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Come, swear it, damn thyself \\n Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves \\n Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd: \\n Swear thou art honest. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Heaven doth truly know it. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O Desdemona! away! away! away! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep? \\n Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? \\n If haply you my father do suspect \\n An instrument of this your calling back, \\n Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him, \\n Why, I have lost him too. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Had it pleased heaven \\n To try me with affliction; had they rain'd \\n All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head. \\n Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips, \\n Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, \\n I should have found in some place of my soul \\n A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me \\n A fixed figure for the time of scorn \\n To point his slow unmoving finger at! \\n Yet could I bear that too; well, very well: \\n But there, where I have garner'd up my heart, \\n Where either I must live, or bear no life; \\n The fountain from the which my current runs, \\n Or else dries up; to be discarded thence! \\n Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads \\n To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there, \\n Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,-- \\n Ay, there, look grim as hell! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I hope my noble lord esteems me honest. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles, \\n That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed, \\n Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet \\n That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst \\n ne'er been born! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, \\n Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed! \\n Committed! O thou public commoner! \\n I should make very forges of my cheeks, \\n That would to cinders burn up modesty, \\n Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed! \\n Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks, \\n The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets \\n Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth, \\n And will not hear it. What committed! \\n Impudent strumpet! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n By heaven, you do me wrong. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Are you not a strumpet? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n No, as I am a Christian: \\n If to preserve this vessel for my lord \\n From any other foul unlawful touch \\n Be not to be a strumpet, I am none. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What, not a whore? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n No, as I shall be saved. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Is't possible? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O, heaven forgive us! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I cry you mercy, then: \\n I took you for that cunning whore of Venice \\n That married with Othello. \\n Raising his voice \\n You, mistress, \\n That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, \\n And keep the gate of hell! \\n Re-enter EMILIA \\n You, you, ay, you! \\n We have done our course; there's money for your pains: \\n I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Alas, what does this gentleman conceive? \\n How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n 'Faith, half asleep. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Good madam, what's the matter with my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n With who? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Why, with my lord, madam. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Who is thy lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n He that is yours, sweet lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia; \\n I cannot weep; nor answer have I none, \\n But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight \\n Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember; \\n And call thy husband hither. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Here's a change indeed! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet. \\n How have I been behaved, that he might stick \\n The small'st opinion on my least misuse? \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What is your pleasure, madam? \\n How is't with you? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes \\n Do it with gentle means and easy tasks: \\n He might have chid me so; for, in good faith, \\n I am a child to chiding. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What's the matter, lady? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her. \\n Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, \\n As true hearts cannot bear. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Am I that name, Iago? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What name, fair lady? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Such as she says my lord did say I was. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink \\n Could not have laid such terms upon his callat. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why did he so? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I do not know; I am sure I am none such. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Hath she forsook so many noble matches, \\n Her father and her country and her friends, \\n To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n It is my wretched fortune. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Beshrew him for't! \\n How comes this trick upon him? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Nay, heaven doth know. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain, \\n Some busy and insinuating rogue, \\n Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, \\n Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n If any such there be, heaven pardon him! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones! \\n Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company? \\n What place? what time? what form? what likelihood? \\n The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave, \\n Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow. \\n O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold, \\n And put in every honest hand a whip \\n To lash the rascals naked through the world \\n Even from the east to the west! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Speak within door. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was \\n That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, \\n And made you to suspect me with the Moor. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You are a fool; go to. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O good Iago, \\n What shall I do to win my lord again? \\n Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven, \\n I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel: \\n If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, \\n Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, \\n Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, \\n Delighted them in any other form; \\n Or that I do not yet, and ever did. \\n And ever will--though he do shake me off \\n To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly, \\n Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much; \\n And his unkindness may defeat my life, \\n But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:' \\n It does abhor me now I speak the word; \\n To do the act that might the addition earn \\n Not the world's mass of vanity could make me. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour: \\n The business of the state does him offence, \\n And he does chide with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n If 'twere no other-- \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n 'Tis but so, I warrant. \\n Trumpets within \\n Hark, how these instruments summon to supper! \\n The messengers of Venice stay the meat; \\n Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well. \\n Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA \\n Enter RODERIGO \\n How now, Roderigo! \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I do not find that thou dealest justly with me. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What in the contrary? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; \\n and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me \\n all conveniency than suppliest me with the least \\n advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure \\n it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what \\n already I have foolishly suffered. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Will you hear me, Roderigo? \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n 'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and \\n performances are no kin together. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You charge me most unjustly. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of \\n my means. The jewels you have had from me to \\n deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a \\n votarist: you have told me she hath received them \\n and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden \\n respect and acquaintance, but I find none. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Well; go to; very well. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis \\n not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin \\n to find myself fobbed in it. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Very well. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself \\n known to Desdemona: if she will return me my \\n jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my \\n unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I \\n will seek satisfaction of you. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n You have said now. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from \\n this instant to build on thee a better opinion than \\n ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast \\n taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I \\n protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n It hath not appeared. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your \\n suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, \\n Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I \\n have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean \\n purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if \\n thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, \\n take me from this world with treachery and devise \\n engines for my life. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice \\n to depute Cassio in Othello's place. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona \\n return again to Venice. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with \\n him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be \\n lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be \\n so determinate as the removing of Cassio. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n How do you mean, removing of him? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; \\n knocking out his brains. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n And that you would have me to do? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. \\n He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I \\n go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable \\n fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which \\n I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, \\n you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near \\n to second your attempt, and he shall fall between \\n us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with \\n me; I will show you such a necessity in his death \\n that you shall think yourself bound to put it on \\n him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows \\n to waste: about it. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I will hear further reason for this. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n And you shall be satisfied. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Another room In the castle. \\n Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and\\nAttendants \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Your honour is most welcome. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Will you walk, sir? \\n O,--Desdemona,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned \\n forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I will, my lord. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n He says he will return incontinent: \\n He hath commanded me to go to bed, \\n And bade me to dismiss you. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Dismiss me! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,. \\n Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu: \\n We must not now displease him. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I would you had never seen him! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n So would not I my love doth so approve him, \\n That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns-- \\n Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds! \\n If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me \\n In one of those same sheets. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Come, come you talk. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n My mother had a maid call'd Barbara: \\n She was in love, and he she loved proved mad \\n And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;' \\n An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune, \\n And she died singing it: that song to-night \\n Will not go from my mind; I have much to do, \\n But to go hang my head all at one side, \\n And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Shall I go fetch your night-gown? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n No, unpin me here. \\n This Lodovico is a proper man. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n A very handsome man. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n He speaks well. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot \\n to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Singing   The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, \\n Sing all a green willow: \\n Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee, \\n Sing willow, willow, willow: \\n The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans; \\n Sing willow, willow, willow; \\n Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones; \\n Lay by these:-- \\n Singing \\n Sing willow, willow, willow; \\n Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:-- \\n Singing \\n Sing all a green willow must be my garland. \\n Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,- \\n Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n It's the wind. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Singing   I call'd my love false love; but what \\n said he then? \\n Sing willow, willow, willow: \\n If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men! \\n So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch; \\n Doth that bode weeping? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n 'Tis neither here nor there. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men! \\n Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,-- \\n That there be women do abuse their husbands \\n In such gross kind? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n There be some such, no question. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Why, would not you? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n No, by this heavenly light! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Nor I neither by this heavenly light; \\n I might do't as well i' the dark. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n The world's a huge thing: it is a great price. \\n For a small vice. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n In troth, I think thou wouldst not. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had \\n done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a \\n joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for \\n gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty \\n exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would \\n not make her husband a cuckold to make him a \\n monarch? I should venture purgatory for't. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong \\n For the whole world. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and \\n having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your \\n own world, and you might quickly make it right. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I do not think there is any such woman. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would \\n store the world they played for. \\n But I do think it is their husbands' faults \\n If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties, \\n And pour our treasures into foreign laps, \\n Or else break out in peevish jealousies, \\n Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us, \\n Or scant our former having in despite; \\n Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, \\n Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know \\n Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell \\n And have their palates both for sweet and sour, \\n As husbands have. What is it that they do \\n When they change us for others? Is it sport? \\n I think it is: and doth affection breed it? \\n I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs? \\n It is so too: and have not we affections, \\n Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? \\n Then let them use us well: else let them know, \\n The ills we do, their ills instruct us so. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send, \\n Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT V \\n\\n SCENE I.  Cyprus. A street. \\n Enter IAGO and RODERIGO \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come: \\n Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home: \\n Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow: \\n It makes us, or it mars us; think on that, \\n And fix most firm thy resolution. \\n \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand. \\n \\n\\n\\n Retires \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I have no great devotion to the deed; \\n And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons: \\n 'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense, \\n And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio, \\n Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, \\n Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo, \\n He calls me to a restitution large \\n Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him, \\n As gifts to Desdemona; \\n It must not be: if Cassio do remain, \\n He hath a daily beauty in his life \\n That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor \\n May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril: \\n No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CASSIO \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest! \\n \\n\\n\\n Makes a pass at CASSIO \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n That thrust had been mine enemy indeed, \\n But that my coat is better than thou know'st \\n I will make proof of thine. \\n \\n\\n\\n Draws, and wounds RODERIGO \\n\\n \\n RODERIGO \\n O, I am slain! \\n \\n\\n\\n IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I am maim'd for ever.

O inhuman dog! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?-- \\n How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!-- \\n What may you be? are you of good or evil? \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n As you shall prove us, praise us. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Signior Lodovico? \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n He, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Cassio! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n How is't, brother! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n My leg is cut in two. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Marry, heaven forbid! \\n Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BIANCA \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Who is't that cried! \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, \\n Cassio, Cassio! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect \\n Who they should be that have thus many led you? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n No. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair, \\n To bear him easily hence! \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash \\n To be a party in this injury. \\n Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come; \\n Lend me a light. Know we this face or no? \\n Alas my friend and my dear countryman \\n Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n What, of Venice? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Even he, sir; did you know him? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Know him! ay. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon; \\n These bloody accidents must excuse my manners, \\n That so neglected you. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n I am glad to see you. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair! \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Roderigo! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n He, he 'tis he. \\n A chair brought in \\n O, that's well said; the chair! \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Some good man bear him carefully from hence; \\n I'll fetch the general's surgeon. \\n To BIANCA \\n For you, mistress, \\n Save you your labour. He that lies slain \\n here, Cassio, \\n Was my dear friend: what malice was between you? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n None in the world; nor do I know the man. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n To BIANCA   What, look you pale? O, bear him out \\n o' the air. \\n CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off \\n Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress? \\n Do you perceive the gastness of her eye? \\n Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon. \\n Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her: \\n Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak, \\n Though tongues were out of use. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter EMILIA \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n 'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Cassio hath here been set on in the dark \\n By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped: \\n He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia, \\n Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night. \\n To BIANCA \\n What, do you shake at that? \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n O, did he so? I charge you, go with me. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet! \\n \\n\\n \\n BIANCA \\n I am no strumpet; but of life as honest \\n As you that thus abuse me. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n As I! foh! fie upon thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd. \\n Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale. \\n Emilia run you to the citadel, \\n And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd. \\n Will you go on? I pray. \\n Aside \\n This is the night \\n That either makes me or fordoes me quite. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep; a light burning. \\n\\n Enter OTHELLO \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,-- \\n Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!-- \\n It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood; \\n Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, \\n And smooth as monumental alabaster. \\n Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men. \\n Put out the light, and then put out the light: \\n If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, \\n I can again thy former light restore, \\n Should I repent me: but once put out thy light, \\n Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, \\n I know not where is that Promethean heat \\n That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose, \\n I cannot give it vital growth again. \\n It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree. \\n Kissing her \\n Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade \\n Justice to break her sword! One more, one more. \\n Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, \\n And love thee after. One more, and this the last: \\n So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep, \\n But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly; \\n It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Who's there? Othello? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay. Desdemona. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Will you come to bed, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Ay, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n If you bethink yourself of any crime \\n Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, \\n Solicit for it straight. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by: \\n I would not kill thy unprepared spirit; \\n No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Talk you of killing? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay, I do. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Then heaven \\n Have mercy on me! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Amen, with all my heart! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n If you say so, I hope you will not kill me. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Hum! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then \\n When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not, \\n Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Think on thy sins. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n They are loves I bear to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay, and for that thou diest. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n That death's unnatural that kills for loving. \\n Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip? \\n Some bloody passion shakes your very frame: \\n These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope, \\n They do not point on me. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Peace, and be still! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n I will so. What's the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee \\n Thou gavest to Cassio. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n No, by my life and soul! \\n Send for the man, and ask him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Sweet soul, take heed, \\n Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Ay, but not yet to die. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Yes, presently: \\n Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin; \\n For to deny each article with oath \\n Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception \\n That I do groan withal. Thou art to die. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Then Lord have mercy on me! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I say, amen. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n And have you mercy too! I never did \\n Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio \\n But with such general warranty of heaven \\n As I might love: I never gave him token. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand. \\n O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart, \\n And makest me call what I intend to do \\n A murder, which I thought a sacrifice: \\n I saw the handkerchief. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n He found it then; \\n I never gave it him: send for him hither; \\n Let him confess a truth. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n He hath confess'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n What, my lord? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That he hath used thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n How? unlawfully? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n He will not say so. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n No, his mouth is stopp'd; \\n Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge \\n Had stomach for them all. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Alas! he is betray'd and I undone. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Down, strumpet! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Nay, if you strive-- \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n But half an hour! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Being done, there is no pause. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n But while I say one prayer! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n It is too late. \\n \\n\\n\\n He stifles her \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Within   My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead? \\n I that am cruel am yet merciful; \\n I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Within   What, ho! my lord, my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Who's there? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Within   O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead. \\n 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.-- \\n The noise was here. Ha! no more moving? \\n Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?-- \\n I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do? \\n If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife: \\n My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife. \\n O insupportable! O heavy hour! \\n Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse \\n Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe \\n Should yawn at alteration. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Within   I do beseech you \\n That I may speak with you, O, good my lord! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia; \\n Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw. \\n Where art thou? \\n Unlocks the door \\n Enter EMILIA \\n What's the matter with thee now? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What, now? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n But now, my lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n It is the very error of the moon; \\n She comes more nearer earth than she was wont, \\n And makes men mad. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian \\n Call'd Roderigo. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Roderigo kill'd! \\n And Cassio kill'd! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n No, Cassio is not kill'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune, \\n And sweet revenge grows harsh. \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n O, falsely, falsely murder'd! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Alas, what cry is that? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That! what? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice. \\n Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again! \\n Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak! \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n A guiltless death I die. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O, who hath done this deed? \\n \\n\\n \\n DESDEMONA \\n Nobody; I myself. Farewell \\n Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell! \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Why, how should she be murder'd? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Alas, who knows? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n You heard her say herself, it was not I. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n She said so: I must needs report the truth. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell: \\n 'Twas I that kill'd her. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O, the more angel she, \\n And you the blacker devil! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n She was false as water. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Thou art rash as fire, to say \\n That she was false: O, she was heavenly true! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else. \\n O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell, \\n But that I did proceed upon just grounds \\n To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n My husband! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Thy husband. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n That she was false to wedlock? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true, \\n If heaven would make me such another world \\n Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite, \\n I'ld not have sold her for it. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n My husband! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay, 'twas he that told me first: \\n An honest man he is, and hates the slime \\n That sticks on filthy deeds. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n My husband! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love, \\n My husband say that she was false! \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n He, woman; \\n I say thy husband: dost understand the word? \\n My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n If he say so, may his pernicious soul \\n Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart: \\n She was too fond of her most filthy bargain. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ha! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Do thy worst: \\n This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven \\n Than thou wast worthy her. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Peace, you were best. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Thou hast not half that power to do me harm \\n As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt! \\n As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed-- \\n I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known, \\n Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help! \\n The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n What is the matter? How now, general! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O, are you come, Iago? you have done well, \\n That men must lay their murders on your neck. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n What is the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man: \\n He says thou told'st him that his wife was false: \\n I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain: \\n Speak, for my heart is full. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I told him what I thought, and told no more \\n Than what he found himself was apt and true. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n But did you ever tell him she was false? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I did. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n You told a lie, an odious, damned lie; \\n Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie. \\n She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak: \\n My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n All \\n O heavens forfend! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n And your reports have set the murder on. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n 'Tis a strange truth. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n O monstrous act! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Villany, villany, villany! \\n I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!-- \\n I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:-- \\n O villany, villany! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak: \\n 'Tis proper I obey him, but not now. \\n Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O! O! O! \\n \\n\\n\\n He falls on the bed \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Nay, lay thee down and roar; \\n For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent \\n That e'er did lift up eye. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Rising   O, she was foul! \\n I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece, \\n Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd: \\n I know this act shows horrible and grim. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead: \\n Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief \\n Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now, \\n This sight would make him do a desperate turn, \\n Yea, curse his better angel from his side, \\n And fall to reprobation. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n 'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows \\n That she with Cassio hath the act of shame \\n A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it: \\n And she did gratify his amorous works \\n With that recognizance and pledge of love \\n Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand: \\n It was a handkerchief, an antique token \\n My father gave my mother. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O heaven! O heavenly powers! \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Come, hold your peace. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n 'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace! \\n No, I will speak as liberal as the north: \\n Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, \\n All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Be wise, and get you home. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n I will not. \\n \\n\\n\\n IAGO offers to stab EMILIA \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Fie! \\n Your sword upon a woman? \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of \\n I found by fortune and did give my husband; \\n For often, with a solemn earnestness, \\n More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle, \\n He begg'd of me to steal it. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Villanous whore! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it, \\n And I did give't my husband. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Filth, thou liest! \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen. \\n O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool \\n Do with so good a woman? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Are there no stones in heaven \\n But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain! \\n \\n\\n\\n He runs at IAGO  IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n He's gone, but his wife's kill'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTANO \\n 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon, \\n Which I have here recover'd from the Moor: \\n Come, guard the door without; let him not pass, \\n But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain, \\n For 'tis a damned slave. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I am not valiant neither, \\n But ever puny whipster gets my sword: \\n But why should honour outlive honesty? \\n Let it go all. \\n \\n\\n \\n EMILIA \\n What did thy song bode, lady? \\n Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan. \\n And die in music. \\n Singing \\n Willow, willow, willow,-- \\n Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor; \\n So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true; \\n So speaking as I think, I die, I die. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I have another weapon in this chamber; \\n It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:-- \\n O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Within   If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear: \\n Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Look in upon me then and speak with me, \\n Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter GRATIANO \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n What is the matter? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Behold, I have a weapon; \\n A better never did itself sustain \\n Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day, \\n That, with this little arm and this good sword, \\n I have made my way through more impediments \\n Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast! \\n Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now. \\n Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd; \\n Here is my journey's end, here is my butt, \\n And very sea-mark of my utmost sail. \\n Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear; \\n Man but a rush against Othello's breast, \\n And he retires. Where should Othello go? \\n Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench! \\n Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt, \\n This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, \\n And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl! \\n Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave! \\n Whip me, ye devils, \\n From the possession of this heavenly sight! \\n Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur! \\n Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire! \\n O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead! \\n Oh! Oh! Oh! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair,\\nand Officers with IAGO, prisoner \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Where is this rash and most unfortunate man? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n That's he that was Othello: here I am. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Where is that viper? bring the villain forth. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable. \\n If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Wounds IAGO \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Wrench his sword from him. \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n I bleed, sir; but not kill'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live; \\n For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n O thou Othello, thou wert once so good, \\n Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave, \\n What shall be said to thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Why, any thing: \\n An honourable murderer, if you will; \\n For nought I did in hate, but all in honour. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n This wretch hath part confess'd his villany: \\n Did you and he consent in Cassio's death? \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Ay. \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Dear general, I never gave you cause. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I do believe it, and I ask your pardon. \\n Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil \\n Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body? \\n \\n\\n \\n IAGO \\n Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: \\n From this time forth I never will speak word. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n What, not to pray? \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n Torments will ope your lips. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Well, thou dost best. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n, \\n Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter \\n Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo; \\n And here another: the one of them imports \\n The death of Cassio to be undertook \\n By Roderigo. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O villain! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n Most heathenish and most gross! \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n Now here's another discontented paper, \\n Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems, \\n Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain; \\n But that belike Iago in the interim \\n Came in and satisfied him. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O the pernicious caitiff! \\n How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief \\n That was my wife's? \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n I found it in my chamber: \\n And he himself confess'd but even now \\n That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose \\n Which wrought to his desire. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n O fool! fool! fool! \\n \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n There is besides in Roderigo's letter, \\n How he upbraids Iago, that he made him \\n Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came \\n That I was cast: and even but now he spake, \\n After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him, \\n Iago set him on. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n You must forsake this room, and go with us: \\n Your power and your command is taken off, \\n And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave, \\n If there be any cunning cruelty \\n That can torment him much and hold him long, \\n It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest, \\n Till that the nature of your fault be known \\n To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n Soft you; a word or two before you go. \\n I have done the state some service, and they know't. \\n No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, \\n When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, \\n Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, \\n Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak \\n Of one that loved not wisely but too well; \\n Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought \\n Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, \\n Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away \\n Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, \\n Albeit unused to the melting mood, \\n Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees \\n Their medicinal gum. Set you down this; \\n And say besides, that in Aleppo once, \\n Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk \\n Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, \\n I took by the throat the circumcised dog, \\n And smote him, thus. \\n \\n\\n\\n Stabs himself \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n O bloody period! \\n \\n\\n \\n GRATIANO \\n All that's spoke is marr'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n OTHELLO \\n I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this; \\n Killing myself, to die upon a kiss. \\n \\n\\n\\n Falls on the bed, and dies \\n\\n \\n CASSIO \\n This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon; \\n For he was great of heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n LODOVICO \\n To IAGO   O Spartan dog, \\n More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea! \\n Look on the tragic loading of this bed; \\n This is thy work: the object poisons sight; \\n Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house, \\n And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, \\n For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor, \\n Remains the censure of this hellish villain; \\n The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it! \\n Myself will straight aboard: and to the state \\n This heavy act with heavy heart relate. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n TITLE \\n\\n\\n\\n The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet \\n\\n\\n\\n FM \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Text placed in the public domain by Moby Lexical Tools, 1992. \\n XML markup by Jon Bosak, 1996-1998. \\n XML Styling done by Ajay Juneja, 1999. \\n This work may be freely copied and distributed worldwide. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n PERSONAE \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dramatis Personae \\n\\n ESCALUS, prince of Verona.  \\n PARIS, a young nobleman, kinsman to the prince. \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n CAPULET \\n heads of two houses at variance with each other. \\n \\n\\n An old man, cousin to Capulet.  \\n ROMEO, son to Montague. \\n MERCUTIO, kinsman to the prince, and friend to Romeo. \\n BENVOLIO, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo. \\n TYBALT, nephew to Lady Capulet. \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n FRIAR JOHN \\n Franciscans. \\n \\n\\n BALTHASAR, servant to Romeo. \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n GREGORY \\n servants to Capulet. \\n \\n\\n PETER, servant to Juliet's nurse. \\n ABRAHAM, servant to Montague. \\n An Apothecary.  \\n Three Musicians. \\n Page to Paris; another Page; an officer. \\n LADY MONTAGUE, wife to Montague. \\n LADY CAPULET, wife to Capulet. \\n JULIET, daughter to Capulet. \\n Nurse to Juliet.  \\n Citizens of Verona; several Men and Women, relations to both houses; Maskers, Guards, Watchmen, and Attendants. \\n Chorus. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n SCNDESCR \\n\\n\\n\\n SCENE  Verona: Mantua. \\n\\n\\n\\n PLAYSUBT \\n\\n\\n\\n ROMEO AND JULIET \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT I \\n\\n PROLOGUE \\n \\n Two households, both alike in dignity, \\n In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, \\n From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, \\n Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. \\n From forth the fatal loins of these two foes \\n A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; \\n Whole misadventured piteous overthrows \\n Do with their death bury their parents' strife. \\n The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, \\n And the continuance of their parents' rage, \\n Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, \\n Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; \\n The which if you with patient ears attend, \\n What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. \\n \\n \\n\\n SCENE I.  Verona. A public place. \\n Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,\\narmed with swords and bucklers \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n No, for then we should be colliers. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n I strike quickly, being moved. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n But thou art not quickly moved to strike. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n A dog of the house of Montague moves me. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: \\n therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will \\n take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes \\n to the wall. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, \\n are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push \\n Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids \\n to the wall. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I \\n have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the \\n maids, and cut off their heads. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n The heads of the maids? \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; \\n take it in what sense thou wilt. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n They must take it in sense that feel it. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and \\n 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou \\n hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes \\n two of the house of the Montagues. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n How! turn thy back and run? \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Fear me not. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n No, marry; I fear thee! \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as \\n they list. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; \\n which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR \\n\\n \\n ABRAHAM \\n Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n I do bite my thumb, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n ABRAHAM \\n Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Aside to GREGORY   Is the law of our side, if I say \\n ay? \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n No. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I \\n bite my thumb, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n Do you quarrel, sir? \\n \\n\\n \\n ABRAHAM \\n Quarrel sir! no, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you. \\n \\n\\n \\n ABRAHAM \\n No better. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Well, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n GREGORY \\n Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Yes, better, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n ABRAHAM \\n You lie. \\n \\n\\n \\n SAMPSON \\n Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. \\n \\n\\n They fight \\n Enter BENVOLIO \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Part, fools! \\n Put up your swords; you know not what you do. \\n \\n\\n Beats down their swords \\n Enter TYBALT \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? \\n Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, \\n Or manage it to part these men with me. \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word, \\n As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: \\n Have at thee, coward! \\n \\n\\n They fight \\n Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;\\nthen enter Citizens, with clubs \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! \\n Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, \\n And flourishes his blade in spite of me. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MONTAGUE \\n Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter PRINCE, with Attendants \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, \\n Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,-- \\n Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, \\n That quench the fire of your pernicious rage \\n With purple fountains issuing from your veins, \\n On pain of torture, from those bloody hands \\n Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, \\n And hear the sentence of your moved prince. \\n Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, \\n By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, \\n Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, \\n And made Verona's ancient citizens \\n Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, \\n To wield old partisans, in hands as old, \\n Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate: \\n If ever you disturb our streets again, \\n Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. \\n For this time, all the rest depart away: \\n You Capulet; shall go along with me: \\n And, Montague, come you this afternoon, \\n To know our further pleasure in this case, \\n To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. \\n Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? \\n Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Here were the servants of your adversary, \\n And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: \\n I drew to part them: in the instant came \\n The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, \\n Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, \\n He swung about his head and cut the winds, \\n Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn: \\n While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, \\n Came more and more and fought on part and part, \\n Till the prince came, who parted either part. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY MONTAGUE \\n O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? \\n Right glad I am he was not at this fray. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun \\n Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, \\n A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; \\n Where, underneath the grove of sycamore \\n That westward rooteth from the city's side, \\n So early walking did I see your son: \\n Towards him I made, but he was ware of me \\n And stole into the covert of the wood: \\n I, measuring his affections by my own, \\n That most are busied when they're most alone, \\n Pursued my humour not pursuing his, \\n And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n Many a morning hath he there been seen, \\n With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. \\n Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; \\n But all so soon as the all-cheering sun \\n Should in the furthest east begin to draw \\n The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, \\n Away from the light steals home my heavy son, \\n And private in his chamber pens himself, \\n Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out \\n And makes himself an artificial night: \\n Black and portentous must this humour prove, \\n Unless good counsel may the cause remove. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n My noble uncle, do you know the cause? \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n I neither know it nor can learn of him. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Have you importuned him by any means? \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n Both by myself and many other friends: \\n But he, his own affections' counsellor, \\n Is to himself--I will not say how true-- \\n But to himself so secret and so close, \\n So far from sounding and discovery, \\n As is the bud bit with an envious worm, \\n Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, \\n Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. \\n Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow. \\n We would as willingly give cure as know. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n See, where he comes: so please you, step aside; \\n I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n I would thou wert so happy by thy stay, \\n To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Good-morrow, cousin. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Is the day so young? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n But new struck nine. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Ay me! sad hours seem long. \\n Was that my father that went hence so fast? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Not having that, which, having, makes them short. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n In love? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Out-- \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Of love? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Out of her favour, where I am in love. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, \\n Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, \\n Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! \\n Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? \\n Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. \\n Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. \\n Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! \\n O any thing, of nothing first create! \\n O heavy lightness! serious vanity! \\n Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms! \\n Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, \\n sick health! \\n Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! \\n This love feel I, that feel no love in this. \\n Dost thou not laugh? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n No, coz, I rather weep. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Good heart, at what? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n At thy good heart's oppression. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Why, such is love's transgression. \\n Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, \\n Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest \\n With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown \\n Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. \\n Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; \\n Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; \\n Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears: \\n What is it else? a madness most discreet, \\n A choking gall and a preserving sweet. \\n Farewell, my coz. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Soft! I will go along; \\n An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here; \\n This is not Romeo, he's some other where. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Tell me in sadness, who is that you love. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What, shall I groan and tell thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Groan! why, no. \\n But sadly tell me who. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Bid a sick man in sadness make his will: \\n Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill! \\n In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit \\n With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit; \\n And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, \\n From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. \\n She will not stay the siege of loving terms, \\n Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, \\n Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: \\n O, she is rich in beauty, only poor, \\n That when she dies with beauty dies her store. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, \\n For beauty starved with her severity \\n Cuts beauty off from all posterity. \\n She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, \\n To merit bliss by making me despair: \\n She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow \\n Do I live dead that live to tell it now. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Be ruled by me, forget to think of her. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O, teach me how I should forget to think. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n By giving liberty unto thine eyes; \\n Examine other beauties. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n 'Tis the way \\n To call hers exquisite, in question more: \\n These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows \\n Being black put us in mind they hide the fair; \\n He that is strucken blind cannot forget \\n The precious treasure of his eyesight lost: \\n Show me a mistress that is passing fair, \\n What doth her beauty serve, but as a note \\n Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair? \\n Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  A street. \\n Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n But Montague is bound as well as I, \\n In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, \\n For men so old as we to keep the peace. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Of honourable reckoning are you both; \\n And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long. \\n But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n But saying o'er what I have said before: \\n My child is yet a stranger in the world; \\n She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, \\n Let two more summers wither in their pride, \\n Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Younger than she are happy mothers made. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n And too soon marr'd are those so early made. \\n The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she, \\n She is the hopeful lady of my earth: \\n But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, \\n My will to her consent is but a part; \\n An she agree, within her scope of choice \\n Lies my consent and fair according voice. \\n This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, \\n Whereto I have invited many a guest, \\n Such as I love; and you, among the store, \\n One more, most welcome, makes my number more. \\n At my poor house look to behold this night \\n Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: \\n Such comfort as do lusty young men feel \\n When well-apparell'd April on the heel \\n Of limping winter treads, even such delight \\n Among fresh female buds shall you this night \\n Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, \\n And like her most whose merit most shall be: \\n Which on more view, of many mine being one \\n May stand in number, though in reckoning none, \\n Come, go with me. \\n To Servant, giving a paper \\n Go, sirrah, trudge about \\n Through fair Verona; find those persons out \\n Whose names are written there, and to them say, \\n My house and welcome on their pleasure stay. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Find them out whose names are written here! It is \\n written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his \\n yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with \\n his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am \\n sent to find those persons whose names are here \\n writ, and can never find what names the writing \\n person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning, \\n One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; \\n Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; \\n One desperate grief cures with another's languish: \\n Take thou some new infection to thy eye, \\n And the rank poison of the old will die. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n For what, I pray thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n For your broken shin. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Why, Romeo, art thou mad? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; \\n Shut up in prison, kept without my food, \\n Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I \\n pray, can you read any thing you see? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Ay, if I know the letters and the language. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Ye say honestly: rest you merry! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Stay, fellow; I can read. \\n Reads \\n 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; \\n County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady \\n widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely \\n nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine \\n uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece \\n Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin \\n Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair \\n assembly: whither should they come? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Up. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Whither? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n To supper; to our house. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Whose house? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n My master's. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before. \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the \\n great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house \\n of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. \\n Rest you merry! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n At this same ancient feast of Capulet's \\n Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest, \\n With all the admired beauties of Verona: \\n Go thither; and, with unattainted eye, \\n Compare her face with some that I shall show, \\n And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n When the devout religion of mine eye \\n Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; \\n And these, who often drown'd could never die, \\n Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! \\n One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun \\n Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, \\n Herself poised with herself in either eye: \\n But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd \\n Your lady's love against some other maid \\n That I will show you shining at this feast, \\n And she shall scant show well that now shows best. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, \\n But to rejoice in splendor of mine own. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A room in Capulet's house. \\n Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old, \\n I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird! \\n God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter JULIET \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n How now! who calls? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Your mother. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Madam, I am here. \\n What is your will? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile, \\n We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again; \\n I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. \\n Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n She's not fourteen. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,-- \\n And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four-- \\n She is not fourteen. How long is it now \\n To Lammas-tide? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n A fortnight and odd days. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Even or odd, of all days in the year, \\n Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. \\n Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!-- \\n Were of an age: well, Susan is with God; \\n She was too good for me: but, as I said, \\n On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; \\n That shall she, marry; I remember it well. \\n 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; \\n And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,-- \\n Of all the days of the year, upon that day: \\n For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, \\n Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; \\n My lord and you were then at Mantua:-- \\n Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said, \\n When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple \\n Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, \\n To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! \\n Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow, \\n To bid me trudge: \\n And since that time it is eleven years; \\n For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, \\n She could have run and waddled all about; \\n For even the day before, she broke her brow: \\n And then my husband--God be with his soul! \\n A' was a merry man--took up the child: \\n 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? \\n Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; \\n Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame, \\n The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.' \\n To see, now, how a jest shall come about! \\n I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, \\n I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; \\n And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.' \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh, \\n To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.' \\n And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow \\n A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; \\n A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly: \\n 'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face? \\n Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; \\n Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.' \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! \\n Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed: \\n An I might live to see thee married once, \\n I have my wish. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme \\n I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, \\n How stands your disposition to be married? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n It is an honour that I dream not of. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n An honour! were not I thine only nurse, \\n I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Well, think of marriage now; younger than you, \\n Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, \\n Are made already mothers: by my count, \\n I was your mother much upon these years \\n That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: \\n The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n A man, young lady! lady, such a man \\n As all the world--why, he's a man of wax. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Verona's summer hath not such a flower. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n What say you? can you love the gentleman? \\n This night you shall behold him at our feast; \\n Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, \\n And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; \\n Examine every married lineament, \\n And see how one another lends content \\n And what obscured in this fair volume lies \\n Find written in the margent of his eyes. \\n This precious book of love, this unbound lover, \\n To beautify him, only lacks a cover: \\n The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride \\n For fair without the fair within to hide: \\n That book in many's eyes doth share the glory, \\n That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; \\n So shall you share all that he doth possess, \\n By having him, making yourself no less. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I'll look to like, if looking liking move: \\n But no more deep will I endart mine eye \\n Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter a Servant \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you \\n called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in \\n the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must \\n hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n We follow thee. \\n Exit Servant \\n Juliet, the county stays. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  A street. \\n Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six\\nMaskers, Torch-bearers, and others \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? \\n Or shall we on without a apology? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n The date is out of such prolixity: \\n We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, \\n Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath, \\n Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; \\n Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke \\n After the prompter, for our entrance: \\n But let them measure us by what they will; \\n We'll measure them a measure, and be gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling; \\n Being but heavy, I will bear the light. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes \\n With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead \\n So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, \\n And soar with them above a common bound. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I am too sore enpierced with his shaft \\n To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, \\n I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe: \\n Under love's heavy burden do I sink. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n And, to sink in it, should you burden love; \\n Too great oppression for a tender thing. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Is love a tender thing? it is too rough, \\n Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n If love be rough with you, be rough with love; \\n Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. \\n Give me a case to put my visage in: \\n A visor for a visor! what care I \\n What curious eye doth quote deformities? \\n Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in, \\n But every man betake him to his legs. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n A torch for me: let wantons light of heart \\n Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels, \\n For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase; \\n I'll be a candle-holder, and look on. \\n The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word: \\n If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire \\n Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st \\n Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Nay, that's not so. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n I mean, sir, in delay \\n We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. \\n Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits \\n Five times in that ere once in our five wits. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n And we mean well in going to this mask; \\n But 'tis no wit to go. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Why, may one ask? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I dream'd a dream to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n And so did I. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Well, what was yours? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n That dreamers often lie. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. \\n She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes \\n In shape no bigger than an agate-stone \\n On the fore-finger of an alderman, \\n Drawn with a team of little atomies \\n Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; \\n Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs, \\n The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, \\n The traces of the smallest spider's web, \\n The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, \\n Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, \\n Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, \\n Not so big as a round little worm \\n Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; \\n Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut \\n Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, \\n Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. \\n And in this state she gallops night by night \\n Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; \\n O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight, \\n O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, \\n O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream, \\n Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, \\n Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: \\n Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, \\n And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; \\n And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail \\n Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, \\n Then dreams, he of another benefice: \\n Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, \\n And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, \\n Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, \\n Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon \\n Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, \\n And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two \\n And sleeps again. This is that very Mab \\n That plats the manes of horses in the night, \\n And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, \\n Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes: \\n This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, \\n That presses them and learns them first to bear, \\n Making them women of good carriage: \\n This is she-- \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! \\n Thou talk'st of nothing. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n True, I talk of dreams, \\n Which are the children of an idle brain, \\n Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, \\n Which is as thin of substance as the air \\n And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes \\n Even now the frozen bosom of the north, \\n And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, \\n Turning his face to the dew-dropping south. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; \\n Supper is done, and we shall come too late. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I fear, too early: for my mind misgives \\n Some consequence yet hanging in the stars \\n Shall bitterly begin his fearful date \\n With this night's revels and expire the term \\n Of a despised life closed in my breast \\n By some vile forfeit of untimely death. \\n But He, that hath the steerage of my course, \\n Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Strike, drum. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  A hall in Capulet's house. \\n Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He \\n shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Servant \\n When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's \\n hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n Away with the joint-stools, remove the \\n court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save \\n me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let \\n the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. \\n Antony, and Potpan! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Servant \\n Ay, boy, ready. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n You are looked for and called for, asked for and \\n sought for, in the great chamber. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Servant \\n We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be \\n brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house,\\nmeeting the Guests and Maskers \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes \\n Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you. \\n Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all \\n Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, \\n She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now? \\n Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day \\n That I have worn a visor and could tell \\n A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, \\n Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone: \\n You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play. \\n A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. \\n Music plays, and they dance \\n More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up, \\n And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. \\n Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well. \\n Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet; \\n For you and I are past our dancing days: \\n How long is't now since last yourself and I \\n Were in a mask? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Capulet \\n By'r lady, thirty years. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much: \\n 'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio, \\n Come pentecost as quickly as it will, \\n Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Capulet \\n 'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir; \\n His son is thirty. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Will you tell me that? \\n His son was but a ward two years ago. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n To a Servingman   What lady is that, which doth \\n enrich the hand \\n Of yonder knight? \\n \\n\\n \\n Servant \\n I know not, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! \\n It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night \\n Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear; \\n Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! \\n So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, \\n As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. \\n The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand, \\n And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. \\n Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! \\n For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n This, by his voice, should be a Montague. \\n Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave \\n Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, \\n To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? \\n Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, \\n To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, \\n A villain that is hither come in spite, \\n To scorn at our solemnity this night. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Young Romeo is it? \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n 'Tis he, that villain Romeo. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone; \\n He bears him like a portly gentleman; \\n And, to say truth, Verona brags of him \\n To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth: \\n I would not for the wealth of all the town \\n Here in my house do him disparagement: \\n Therefore be patient, take no note of him: \\n It is my will, the which if thou respect, \\n Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, \\n And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n It fits, when such a villain is a guest: \\n I'll not endure him. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n He shall be endured: \\n What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; \\n Am I the master here, or you? go to. \\n You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul! \\n You'll make a mutiny among my guests! \\n You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man! \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Why, uncle, 'tis a shame. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Go to, go to; \\n You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed? \\n This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what: \\n You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time. \\n Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go: \\n Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame! \\n I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts! \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting \\n Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. \\n I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall \\n Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n To JULIET   If I profane with my unworthiest hand \\n This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: \\n My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand \\n To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, \\n Which mannerly devotion shows in this; \\n For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, \\n And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; \\n They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. \\n Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Then have my lips the sin that they have took. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged! \\n Give me my sin again. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n You kiss by the book. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Madam, your mother craves a word with you. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What is her mother? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Marry, bachelor, \\n Her mother is the lady of the house, \\n And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous \\n I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal; \\n I tell you, he that can lay hold of her \\n Shall have the chinks. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Is she a Capulet? \\n O dear account! my life is my foe's debt. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Away, begone; the sport is at the best. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; \\n We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. \\n Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all \\n I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. \\n More torches here!

A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard. \\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Can I go forward when my heart is here? \\n Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. \\n \\n\\n He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it \\n Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Romeo! my cousin Romeo! \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n He is wise; \\n And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall: \\n Call, good Mercutio. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Nay, I'll conjure too. \\n Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! \\n Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh: \\n Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied; \\n Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;' \\n Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, \\n One nick-name for her purblind son and heir, \\n Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim, \\n When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid! \\n He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; \\n The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. \\n I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, \\n By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, \\n By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh \\n And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, \\n That in thy likeness thou appear to us! \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him \\n To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle \\n Of some strange nature, letting it there stand \\n Till she had laid it and conjured it down; \\n That were some spite: my invocation \\n Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name \\n I conjure only but to raise up him. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, \\n To be consorted with the humorous night: \\n Blind is his love and best befits the dark. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. \\n Now will he sit under a medlar tree, \\n And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit \\n As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone. \\n Romeo, that she were, O, that she were \\n An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear! \\n Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; \\n This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep: \\n Come, shall we go? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Go, then; for 'tis in vain \\n To seek him here that means not to be found. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Capulet's orchard. \\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n He jests at scars that never felt a wound. \\n JULIET appears above at a window \\n But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? \\n It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. \\n Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, \\n Who is already sick and pale with grief, \\n That thou her maid art far more fair than she: \\n Be not her maid, since she is envious; \\n Her vestal livery is but sick and green \\n And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. \\n It is my lady, O, it is my love! \\n O, that she knew she were! \\n She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that? \\n Her eye discourses; I will answer it. \\n I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks: \\n Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, \\n Having some business, do entreat her eyes \\n To twinkle in their spheres till they return. \\n What if her eyes were there, they in her head? \\n The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, \\n As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven \\n Would through the airy region stream so bright \\n That birds would sing and think it were not night. \\n See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! \\n O, that I were a glove upon that hand, \\n That I might touch that cheek! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Ay me! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n She speaks: \\n O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art \\n As glorious to this night, being o'er my head \\n As is a winged messenger of heaven \\n Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes \\n Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him \\n When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds \\n And sails upon the bosom of the air. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? \\n Deny thy father and refuse thy name; \\n Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, \\n And I'll no longer be a Capulet. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Aside   Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; \\n Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. \\n What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, \\n Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part \\n Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! \\n What's in a name? that which we call a rose \\n By any other name would smell as sweet; \\n So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, \\n Retain that dear perfection which he owes \\n Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, \\n And for that name which is no part of thee \\n Take all myself. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I take thee at thy word: \\n Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; \\n Henceforth I never will be Romeo. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night \\n So stumblest on my counsel? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n By a name \\n I know not how to tell thee who I am: \\n My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, \\n Because it is an enemy to thee; \\n Had I it written, I would tear the word. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words \\n Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound: \\n Art thou not Romeo and a Montague? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? \\n The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, \\n And the place death, considering who thou art, \\n If any of my kinsmen find thee here. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; \\n For stony limits cannot hold love out, \\n And what love can do that dares love attempt; \\n Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n If they do see thee, they will murder thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye \\n Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, \\n And I am proof against their enmity. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I would not for the world they saw thee here. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; \\n And but thou love me, let them find me here: \\n My life were better ended by their hate, \\n Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n By whose direction found'st thou out this place? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n By love, who first did prompt me to inquire; \\n He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes. \\n I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far \\n As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, \\n I would adventure for such merchandise. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, \\n Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek \\n For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night \\n Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny \\n What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! \\n Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' \\n And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, \\n Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries \\n Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, \\n If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: \\n Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, \\n I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, \\n So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. \\n In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, \\n And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light: \\n But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true \\n Than those that have more cunning to be strange. \\n I should have been more strange, I must confess, \\n But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, \\n My true love's passion: therefore pardon me, \\n And not impute this yielding to light love, \\n Which the dark night hath so discovered. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear \\n That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-- \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, \\n That monthly changes in her circled orb, \\n Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What shall I swear by? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Do not swear at all; \\n Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, \\n Which is the god of my idolatry, \\n And I'll believe thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n If my heart's dear love-- \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee, \\n I have no joy of this contract to-night: \\n It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; \\n Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be \\n Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! \\n This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, \\n May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. \\n Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest \\n Come to thy heart as that within my breast! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I gave thee mine before thou didst request it: \\n And yet I would it were to give again. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n But to be frank, and give it thee again. \\n And yet I wish but for the thing I have: \\n My bounty is as boundless as the sea, \\n My love as deep; the more I give to thee, \\n The more I have, for both are infinite. \\n Nurse calls within \\n I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu! \\n Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. \\n Stay but a little, I will come again. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit, above \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard. \\n Being in night, all this is but a dream, \\n Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter JULIET, above \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. \\n If that thy bent of love be honourable, \\n Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, \\n By one that I'll procure to come to thee, \\n Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; \\n And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay \\n And follow thee my lord throughout the world. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Within   Madam! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well, \\n I do beseech thee-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Within   Madam! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n By and by, I come:-- \\n To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: \\n To-morrow will I send. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n So thrive my soul-- \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n A thousand times good night! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit, above \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. \\n Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from \\n their books, \\n But love from love, toward school with heavy looks. \\n \\n\\n Retiring \\n Re-enter JULIET, above \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice, \\n To lure this tassel-gentle back again! \\n Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud; \\n Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, \\n And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, \\n With repetition of my Romeo's name. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n It is my soul that calls upon my name: \\n How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, \\n Like softest music to attending ears! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Romeo! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n My dear? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n At what o'clock to-morrow \\n Shall I send to thee? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n At the hour of nine. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then. \\n I have forgot why I did call thee back. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Let me stand here till thou remember it. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, \\n Remembering how I love thy company. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, \\n Forgetting any other home but this. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone: \\n And yet no further than a wanton's bird; \\n Who lets it hop a little from her hand, \\n Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, \\n And with a silk thread plucks it back again, \\n So loving-jealous of his liberty. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I would I were thy bird. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Sweet, so would I: \\n Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. \\n Good night, good night! parting is such \\n sweet sorrow, \\n That I shall say good night till it be morrow. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit above \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! \\n Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! \\n Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell, \\n His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Friar Laurence's cell. \\n Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, \\n Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, \\n And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels \\n From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: \\n Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, \\n The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, \\n I must up-fill this osier cage of ours \\n With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. \\n The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb; \\n What is her burying grave that is her womb, \\n And from her womb children of divers kind \\n We sucking on her natural bosom find, \\n Many for many virtues excellent, \\n None but for some and yet all different. \\n O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies \\n In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities: \\n For nought so vile that on the earth doth live \\n But to the earth some special good doth give, \\n Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use \\n Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: \\n Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied; \\n And vice sometimes by action dignified. \\n Within the infant rind of this small flower \\n Poison hath residence and medicine power: \\n For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; \\n Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. \\n Two such opposed kings encamp them still \\n In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; \\n And where the worser is predominant, \\n Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Good morrow, father. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Benedicite! \\n What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? \\n Young son, it argues a distemper'd head \\n So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: \\n Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, \\n And where care lodges, sleep will never lie; \\n But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain \\n Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: \\n Therefore thy earliness doth me assure \\n Thou art up-roused by some distemperature; \\n Or if not so, then here I hit it right, \\n Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no; \\n I have forgot that name, and that name's woe. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again. \\n I have been feasting with mine enemy, \\n Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, \\n That's by me wounded: both our remedies \\n Within thy help and holy physic lies: \\n I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, \\n My intercession likewise steads my foe. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; \\n Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set \\n On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: \\n As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; \\n And all combined, save what thou must combine \\n By holy marriage: when and where and how \\n We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow, \\n I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, \\n That thou consent to marry us to-day. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! \\n Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, \\n So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies \\n Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. \\n Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine \\n Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! \\n How much salt water thrown away in waste, \\n To season love, that of it doth not taste! \\n The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, \\n Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; \\n Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit \\n Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet: \\n If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, \\n Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline: \\n And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then, \\n Women may fall, when there's no strength in men. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n And bad'st me bury love. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Not in a grave, \\n To lay one in, another out to have. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now \\n Doth grace for grace and love for love allow; \\n The other did not so. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n O, she knew well \\n Thy love did read by rote and could not spell. \\n But come, young waverer, come, go with me, \\n In one respect I'll thy assistant be; \\n For this alliance may so happy prove, \\n To turn your households' rancour to pure love. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  A street. \\n Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Where the devil should this Romeo be? \\n Came he not home to-night? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Not to his father's; I spoke with his man. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. \\n Torments him so, that he will sure run mad. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, \\n Hath sent a letter to his father's house. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n A challenge, on my life. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Romeo will answer it. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Any man that can write may answer a letter. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he \\n dares, being dared. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a \\n white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a \\n love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the \\n blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to \\n encounter Tybalt? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Why, what is Tybalt? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is \\n the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as \\n you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and \\n proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and \\n the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk \\n button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the \\n very first house, of the first and second cause: \\n ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the \\n hai! \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n The what? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting \\n fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu, \\n a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good \\n whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing, \\n grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with \\n these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these \\n perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form, \\n that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their \\n bones, their bones! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh, \\n how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers \\n that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a \\n kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to \\n be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy; \\n Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey \\n eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior \\n Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation \\n to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit \\n fairly last night. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in \\n such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n That's as much as to say, such a case as yours \\n constrains a man to bow in the hams. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Meaning, to court'sy. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Thou hast most kindly hit it. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n A most courteous exposition. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Pink for flower. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Right. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Why, then is my pump well flowered. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast \\n worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it \\n is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O single-soled jest, solely singular for the \\n singleness. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have \\n done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of \\n thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five: \\n was I with you there for the goose? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast \\n not there for the goose. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Nay, good goose, bite not. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most \\n sharp sauce. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n And is it not well served in to a sweet goose? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an \\n inch narrow to an ell broad! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added \\n to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? \\n now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art \\n thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: \\n for this drivelling love is like a great natural, \\n that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Stop there, stop there. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: \\n for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and \\n meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Here's goodly gear! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Nurse and PETER \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n A sail, a sail! \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Two, two; a shirt and a smock. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Peter! \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n Anon! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n My fan, Peter. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the \\n fairer face. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n God ye good morrow, gentlemen. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Is it good den? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n 'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the \\n dial is now upon the prick of noon. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Out upon you! what a man are you! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to \\n mar. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' \\n quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I \\n may find the young Romeo? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when \\n you have found him than he was when you sought him: \\n I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n You say well. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; \\n wisely, wisely. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with \\n you. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n She will indite him to some supper. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What hast thou found? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, \\n that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent. \\n Sings \\n An old hare hoar, \\n And an old hare hoar, \\n Is very good meat in lent \\n But a hare that is hoar \\n Is too much for a score, \\n When it hoars ere it be spent. \\n Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll \\n to dinner, thither. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I will follow you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, \\n Singing \\n 'lady, lady, lady.' \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy \\n merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, \\n and will speak more in a minute than he will stand \\n to in a month. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him \\n down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such \\n Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. \\n Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am \\n none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by \\n too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure? \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon \\n should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare \\n draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a \\n good quarrel, and the law on my side. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about \\n me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word: \\n and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you \\n out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself: \\n but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into \\n a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross \\n kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman \\n is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double \\n with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered \\n to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I \\n protest unto thee-- \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much: \\n Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as \\n I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Bid her devise \\n Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; \\n And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell \\n Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n No truly sir; not a penny. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Go to; I say you shall. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall: \\n Within this hour my man shall be with thee \\n And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair; \\n Which to the high top-gallant of my joy \\n Must be my convoy in the secret night. \\n Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains: \\n Farewell; commend me to thy mistress. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What say'st thou, my dear nurse? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say, \\n Two may keep counsel, putting one away? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel. \\n \\n\\n \\n NURSE \\n Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord, \\n Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there \\n is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain \\n lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief \\n see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her \\n sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer \\n man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks \\n as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not \\n rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for \\n the--No; I know it begins with some other \\n letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of \\n it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good \\n to hear it. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Commend me to thy lady. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Ay, a thousand times. \\n Exit Romeo \\n Peter! \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n Anon! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Capulet's orchard. \\n Enter JULIET \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; \\n In half an hour she promised to return. \\n Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so. \\n O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, \\n Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, \\n Driving back shadows over louring hills: \\n Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love, \\n And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. \\n Now is the sun upon the highmost hill \\n Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve \\n Is three long hours, yet she is not come. \\n Had she affections and warm youthful blood, \\n She would be as swift in motion as a ball; \\n My words would bandy her to my sweet love, \\n And his to me: \\n But old folks, many feign as they were dead; \\n Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. \\n O God, she comes! \\n Enter Nurse and PETER \\n O honey nurse, what news? \\n Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Peter, stay at the gate. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit PETER \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad? \\n Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; \\n If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news \\n By playing it to me with so sour a face. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: \\n Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: \\n Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile? \\n Do you not see that I am out of breath? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath \\n To say to me that thou art out of breath? \\n The excuse that thou dost make in this delay \\n Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. \\n Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that; \\n Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance: \\n Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not \\n how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his \\n face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels \\n all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, \\n though they be not to be talked on, yet they are \\n past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy, \\n but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy \\n ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n No, no: but all this did I know before. \\n What says he of our marriage? what of that? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! \\n It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. \\n My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back! \\n Beshrew your heart for sending me about, \\n To catch my death with jaunting up and down! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. \\n Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a \\n courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I \\n warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Where is my mother! why, she is within; \\n Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! \\n 'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, \\n Where is your mother?' \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n O God's lady dear! \\n Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow; \\n Is this the poultice for my aching bones? \\n Henceforward do your messages yourself. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I have. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell; \\n There stays a husband to make you a wife: \\n Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, \\n They'll be in scarlet straight at any news. \\n Hie you to church; I must another way, \\n To fetch a ladder, by the which your love \\n Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark: \\n I am the drudge and toil in your delight, \\n But you shall bear the burden soon at night. \\n Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE VI.  Friar Laurence's cell. \\n Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n So smile the heavens upon this holy act, \\n That after hours with sorrow chide us not! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, \\n It cannot countervail the exchange of joy \\n That one short minute gives me in her sight: \\n Do thou but close our hands with holy words, \\n Then love-devouring death do what he dare; \\n It is enough I may but call her mine. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n These violent delights have violent ends \\n And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, \\n Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey \\n Is loathsome in his own deliciousness \\n And in the taste confounds the appetite: \\n Therefore love moderately; long love doth so; \\n Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. \\n Enter JULIET \\n Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot \\n Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint: \\n A lover may bestride the gossamer \\n That idles in the wanton summer air, \\n And yet not fall; so light is vanity. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Good even to my ghostly confessor. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n As much to him, else is his thanks too much. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy \\n Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more \\n To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath \\n This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue \\n Unfold the imagined happiness that both \\n Receive in either by this dear encounter. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, \\n Brags of his substance, not of ornament: \\n They are but beggars that can count their worth; \\n But my true love is grown to such excess \\n I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Come, come with me, and we will make short work; \\n For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone \\n Till holy church incorporate two in one. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT III \\n\\n SCENE I.  A public place. \\n Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: \\n The day is hot, the Capulets abroad, \\n And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; \\n For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Thou art like one of those fellows that when he \\n enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword \\n upon the table and says 'God send me no need of \\n thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws \\n it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Am I like such a fellow? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as \\n any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as \\n soon moody to be moved. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n And what to? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Nay, an there were two such, we should have none \\n shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, \\n thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more, \\n or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou \\n wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no \\n other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what \\n eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? \\n Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of \\n meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as \\n an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a \\n man for coughing in the street, because he hath \\n wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: \\n didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing \\n his new doublet before Easter? with another, for \\n tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou \\n wilt tutor me from quarrelling! \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man \\n should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n The fee-simple! O simple! \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n By my head, here come the Capulets. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n By my heel, I care not. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter TYBALT and others \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Follow me close, for I will speak to them. \\n Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n And but one word with one of us? couple it with \\n something; make it a word and a blow. \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you \\n will give me occasion. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Could you not take some occasion without giving? \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,-- \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an \\n thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but \\n discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall \\n make you dance. 'Zounds, consort! \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n We talk here in the public haunt of men: \\n Either withdraw unto some private place, \\n And reason coldly of your grievances, \\n Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze; \\n I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery: \\n Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower; \\n Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.' \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford \\n No better term than this,--thou art a villain. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee \\n Doth much excuse the appertaining rage \\n To such a greeting: villain am I none; \\n Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not. \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries \\n That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I do protest, I never injured thee, \\n But love thee better than thou canst devise, \\n Till thou shalt know the reason of my love: \\n And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender \\n As dearly as my own,--be satisfied. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! \\n Alla stoccata carries it away. \\n Draws \\n Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk? \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n What wouldst thou have with me? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine \\n lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you \\n shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the \\n eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher \\n by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your \\n ears ere it be out. \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n I am for you. \\n \\n\\n\\n Drawing \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Come, sir, your passado. \\n \\n\\n\\n They fight \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. \\n Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage! \\n Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath \\n Forbidden bandying in Verona streets: \\n Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio! \\n \\n\\n\\n TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies\\nwith his followers \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n I am hurt. \\n A plague o' both your houses! I am sped. \\n Is he gone, and hath nothing? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n What, art thou hurt? \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. \\n Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit Page \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a \\n church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for \\n me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I \\n am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' \\n both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a \\n cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a \\n rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of \\n arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I \\n was hurt under your arm. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I thought all for the best. \\n \\n\\n \\n MERCUTIO \\n Help me into some house, Benvolio, \\n Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses! \\n They have made worms' meat of me: I have it, \\n And soundly too: your houses! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n This gentleman, the prince's near ally, \\n My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt \\n In my behalf; my reputation stain'd \\n With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour \\n Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet, \\n Thy beauty hath made me effeminate \\n And in my temper soften'd valour's steel! \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter BENVOLIO \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! \\n That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, \\n Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n This day's black fate on more days doth depend; \\n This but begins the woe, others must end. \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain! \\n Away to heaven, respective lenity, \\n And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now! \\n Re-enter TYBALT \\n Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again, \\n That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul \\n Is but a little way above our heads, \\n Staying for thine to keep him company: \\n Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him. \\n \\n\\n \\n TYBALT \\n Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, \\n Shalt with him hence. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n This shall determine that. \\n \\n\\n\\n They fight; TYBALT falls \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Romeo, away, be gone! \\n The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. \\n Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death, \\n If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O, I am fortune's fool! \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Why dost thou stay? \\n \\n\\n Exit ROMEO \\n Enter Citizens, &c \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio? \\n Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n There lies that Tybalt. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Citizen \\n Up, sir, go with me; \\n I charge thee in the princes name, obey. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their\\nWives, and others \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Where are the vile beginners of this fray? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n O noble prince, I can discover all \\n The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl: \\n There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, \\n That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child! \\n O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt \\n O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, \\n For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague. \\n O cousin, cousin! \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? \\n \\n\\n \\n BENVOLIO \\n Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay; \\n Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink \\n How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal \\n Your high displeasure: all this uttered \\n With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, \\n Could not take truce with the unruly spleen \\n Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts \\n With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, \\n Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point, \\n And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats \\n Cold death aside, and with the other sends \\n It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity, \\n Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud, \\n 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than \\n his tongue, \\n His agile arm beats down their fatal points, \\n And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm \\n An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life \\n Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; \\n But by and by comes back to Romeo, \\n Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, \\n And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I \\n Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain. \\n And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. \\n This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n He is a kinsman to the Montague; \\n Affection makes him false; he speaks not true: \\n Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, \\n And all those twenty could but kill one life. \\n I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; \\n Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio; \\n Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend; \\n His fault concludes but what the law should end, \\n The life of Tybalt. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n And for that offence \\n Immediately we do exile him hence: \\n I have an interest in your hate's proceeding, \\n My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; \\n But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine \\n That you shall all repent the loss of mine: \\n I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; \\n Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses: \\n Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste, \\n Else, when he's found, that hour is his last. \\n Bear hence this body and attend our will: \\n Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Capulet's orchard. \\n Enter JULIET \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, \\n Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner \\n As Phaethon would whip you to the west, \\n And bring in cloudy night immediately. \\n Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, \\n That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo \\n Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen. \\n Lovers can see to do their amorous rites \\n By their own beauties; or, if love be blind, \\n It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, \\n Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, \\n And learn me how to lose a winning match, \\n Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods: \\n Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, \\n With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold, \\n Think true love acted simple modesty. \\n Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night; \\n For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night \\n Whiter than new snow on a raven's back. \\n Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night, \\n Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, \\n Take him and cut him out in little stars, \\n And he will make the face of heaven so fine \\n That all the world will be in love with night \\n And pay no worship to the garish sun. \\n O, I have bought the mansion of a love, \\n But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold, \\n Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day \\n As is the night before some festival \\n To an impatient child that hath new robes \\n And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse, \\n And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks \\n But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. \\n Enter Nurse, with cords \\n Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords \\n That Romeo bid thee fetch? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Ay, ay, the cords. \\n \\n\\n\\n Throws them down \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! \\n We are undone, lady, we are undone! \\n Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Can heaven be so envious? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Romeo can, \\n Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo! \\n Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus? \\n This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell. \\n Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,' \\n And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more \\n Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice: \\n I am not I, if there be such an I; \\n Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.' \\n If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no: \\n Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,-- \\n God save the mark!--here on his manly breast: \\n A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; \\n Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, \\n All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once! \\n To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty! \\n Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here; \\n And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! \\n O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman! \\n That ever I should live to see thee dead! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n What storm is this that blows so contrary? \\n Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead? \\n My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord? \\n Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! \\n For who is living, if those two are gone? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; \\n Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n It did, it did; alas the day, it did! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! \\n Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? \\n Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! \\n Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! \\n Despised substance of divinest show! \\n Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st, \\n A damned saint, an honourable villain! \\n O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell, \\n When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend \\n In moral paradise of such sweet flesh? \\n Was ever book containing such vile matter \\n So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell \\n In such a gorgeous palace! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n There's no trust, \\n No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured, \\n All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. \\n Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae: \\n These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. \\n Shame come to Romeo! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Blister'd be thy tongue \\n For such a wish! he was not born to shame: \\n Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit; \\n For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd \\n Sole monarch of the universal earth. \\n O, what a beast was I to chide at him! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? \\n Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, \\n When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? \\n But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? \\n That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband: \\n Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; \\n Your tributary drops belong to woe, \\n Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. \\n My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; \\n And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: \\n All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then? \\n Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, \\n That murder'd me: I would forget it fain; \\n But, O, it presses to my memory, \\n Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds: \\n 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;' \\n That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' \\n Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death \\n Was woe enough, if it had ended there: \\n Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship \\n And needly will be rank'd with other griefs, \\n Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,' \\n Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, \\n Which modern lamentations might have moved? \\n But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death, \\n 'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word, \\n Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, \\n All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!' \\n There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, \\n In that word's death; no words can that woe sound. \\n Where is my father, and my mother, nurse? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse: \\n Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, \\n When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. \\n Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled, \\n Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled: \\n He made you for a highway to my bed; \\n But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. \\n Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed; \\n And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo \\n To comfort you: I wot well where he is. \\n Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night: \\n I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O, find him! give this ring to my true knight, \\n And bid him come to take his last farewell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Friar Laurence's cell. \\n Enter FRIAR LAURENCE \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man: \\n Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts, \\n And thou art wedded to calamity. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Father, what news? what is the prince's doom? \\n What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, \\n That I yet know not? \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Too familiar \\n Is my dear son with such sour company: \\n I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom? \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, \\n Not body's death, but body's banishment. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;' \\n For exile hath more terror in his look, \\n Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.' \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Hence from Verona art thou banished: \\n Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n There is no world without Verona walls, \\n But purgatory, torture, hell itself. \\n Hence-banished is banish'd from the world, \\n And world's exile is death: then banished, \\n Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment, \\n Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, \\n And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! \\n Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, \\n Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, \\n And turn'd that black word death to banishment: \\n This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, \\n Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog \\n And little mouse, every unworthy thing, \\n Live here in heaven and may look on her; \\n But Romeo may not: more validity, \\n More honourable state, more courtship lives \\n In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize \\n On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand \\n And steal immortal blessing from her lips, \\n Who even in pure and vestal modesty, \\n Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; \\n But Romeo may not; he is banished: \\n Flies may do this, but I from this must fly: \\n They are free men, but I am banished. \\n And say'st thou yet that exile is not death? \\n Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife, \\n No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, \\n But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'? \\n O friar, the damned use that word in hell; \\n Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart, \\n Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, \\n A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd, \\n To mangle me with that word 'banished'? \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n I'll give thee armour to keep off that word: \\n Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, \\n To comfort thee, though thou art banished. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy! \\n Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, \\n Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, \\n It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n O, then I see that madmen have no ears. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel: \\n Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, \\n An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, \\n Doting like me and like me banished, \\n Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, \\n And fall upon the ground, as I do now, \\n Taking the measure of an unmade grave. \\n \\n\\n\\n Knocking within \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans, \\n Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes. \\n \\n\\n\\n Knocking \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise; \\n Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up; \\n Knocking \\n Run to my study. By and by! God's will, \\n What simpleness is this! I come, I come! \\n Knocking \\n Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Within   Let me come in, and you shall know \\n my errand; \\n I come from Lady Juliet. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Welcome, then. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Nurse \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar, \\n Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo? \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n O, he is even in my mistress' case, \\n Just in her case! O woful sympathy! \\n Piteous predicament! Even so lies she, \\n Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. \\n Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man: \\n For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; \\n Why should you fall into so deep an O? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Nurse! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her? \\n Doth she not think me an old murderer, \\n Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy \\n With blood removed but little from her own? \\n Where is she? and how doth she? and what says \\n My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; \\n And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, \\n And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries, \\n And then down falls again. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n As if that name, \\n Shot from the deadly level of a gun, \\n Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand \\n Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me, \\n In what vile part of this anatomy \\n Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack \\n The hateful mansion. \\n \\n\\n\\n Drawing his sword \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Hold thy desperate hand: \\n Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art: \\n Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote \\n The unreasonable fury of a beast: \\n Unseemly woman in a seeming man! \\n Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! \\n Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order, \\n I thought thy disposition better temper'd. \\n Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? \\n And stay thy lady too that lives in thee, \\n By doing damned hate upon thyself? \\n Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? \\n Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet \\n In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. \\n Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit; \\n Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, \\n And usest none in that true use indeed \\n Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit: \\n Thy noble shape is but a form of wax, \\n Digressing from the valour of a man; \\n Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, \\n Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; \\n Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, \\n Misshapen in the conduct of them both, \\n Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask, \\n Is set afire by thine own ignorance, \\n And thou dismember'd with thine own defence. \\n What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive, \\n For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead; \\n There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, \\n But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too: \\n The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend \\n And turns it to exile; there art thou happy: \\n A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back; \\n Happiness courts thee in her best array; \\n But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, \\n Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love: \\n Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. \\n Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, \\n Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: \\n But look thou stay not till the watch be set, \\n For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; \\n Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time \\n To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, \\n Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back \\n With twenty hundred thousand times more joy \\n Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. \\n Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; \\n And bid her hasten all the house to bed, \\n Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: \\n Romeo is coming. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night \\n To hear good counsel: O, what learning is! \\n My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir: \\n Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n How well my comfort is revived by this! \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state: \\n Either be gone before the watch be set, \\n Or by the break of day disguised from hence: \\n Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man, \\n And he shall signify from time to time \\n Every good hap to you that chances here: \\n Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n But that a joy past joy calls out on me, \\n It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.  A room in Capulet's house. \\n Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, \\n That we have had no time to move our daughter: \\n Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, \\n And so did I:--Well, we were born to die. \\n 'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night: \\n I promise you, but for your company, \\n I would have been a-bed an hour ago. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n These times of woe afford no time to woo. \\n Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; \\n To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender \\n Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled \\n In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not. \\n Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; \\n Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love; \\n And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next-- \\n But, soft! what day is this? \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Monday, my lord, \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon, \\n O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her, \\n She shall be married to this noble earl. \\n Will you be ready? do you like this haste? \\n We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two; \\n For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, \\n It may be thought we held him carelessly, \\n Being our kinsman, if we revel much: \\n Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, \\n And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then. \\n Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed, \\n Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. \\n Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho! \\n Afore me! it is so very very late, \\n That we may call it early by and by. \\n Good night. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.  Capulet's orchard. \\n Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: \\n It was the nightingale, and not the lark, \\n That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; \\n Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree: \\n Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n It was the lark, the herald of the morn, \\n No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks \\n Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: \\n Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day \\n Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. \\n I must be gone and live, or stay and die. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I: \\n It is some meteor that the sun exhales, \\n To be to thee this night a torch-bearer, \\n And light thee on thy way to Mantua: \\n Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death; \\n I am content, so thou wilt have it so. \\n I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, \\n 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; \\n Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat \\n The vaulty heaven so high above our heads: \\n I have more care to stay than will to go: \\n Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. \\n How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away! \\n It is the lark that sings so out of tune, \\n Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. \\n Some say the lark makes sweet division; \\n This doth not so, for she divideth us: \\n Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes, \\n O, now I would they had changed voices too! \\n Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, \\n Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day, \\n O, now be gone; more light and light it grows. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n More light and light; more dark and dark our woes! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Nurse, to the chamber \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Madam! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Nurse? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Your lady mother is coming to your chamber: \\n The day is broke; be wary, look about. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Then, window, let day in, and let life out. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend. \\n \\n\\n\\n He goeth down \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend! \\n I must hear from thee every day in the hour, \\n For in a minute there are many days: \\n O, by this count I shall be much in years \\n Ere I again behold my Romeo! \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Farewell! \\n I will omit no opportunity \\n That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O think'st thou we shall ever meet again? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve \\n For sweet discourses in our time to come. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O God, I have an ill-divining soul! \\n Methinks I see thee, now thou art below, \\n As one dead in the bottom of a tomb: \\n Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n And trust me, love, in my eye so do you: \\n Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle: \\n If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him. \\n That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune; \\n For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, \\n But send him back. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Within          Ho, daughter! are you up? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother? \\n Is she not down so late, or up so early? \\n What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LADY CAPULET \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Why, how now, Juliet! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Madam, I am not well. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Evermore weeping for your cousin's death? \\n What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? \\n An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; \\n Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love; \\n But much of grief shows still some want of wit. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend \\n Which you weep for. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Feeling so the loss, \\n Cannot choose but ever weep the friend. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, \\n As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n What villain madam? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n That same villain, Romeo. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Aside   Villain and he be many miles asunder.-- \\n God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart; \\n And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n That is, because the traitor murderer lives. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands: \\n Would none but I might venge my cousin's death! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not: \\n Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua, \\n Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, \\n Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram, \\n That he shall soon keep Tybalt company: \\n And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Indeed, I never shall be satisfied \\n With Romeo, till I behold him--dead-- \\n Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd. \\n Madam, if you could find out but a man \\n To bear a poison, I would temper it; \\n That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, \\n Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors \\n To hear him named, and cannot come to him. \\n To wreak the love I bore my cousin \\n Upon his body that slaughter'd him! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. \\n But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n And joy comes well in such a needy time: \\n What are they, I beseech your ladyship? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; \\n One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, \\n Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, \\n That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Madam, in happy time, what day is that? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, \\n The gallant, young and noble gentleman, \\n The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, \\n Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, \\n He shall not make me there a joyful bride. \\n I wonder at this haste; that I must wed \\n Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo. \\n I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, \\n I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear, \\n It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, \\n Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Here comes your father; tell him so yourself, \\n And see how he will take it at your hands. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CAPULET and Nurse \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; \\n But for the sunset of my brother's son \\n It rains downright. \\n How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? \\n Evermore showering? In one little body \\n Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind; \\n For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, \\n Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, \\n Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; \\n Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them, \\n Without a sudden calm, will overset \\n Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife! \\n Have you deliver'd to her our decree? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. \\n I would the fool were married to her grave! \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. \\n How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks? \\n Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, \\n Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought \\n So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have: \\n Proud can I never be of what I hate; \\n But thankful even for hate, that is meant love. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this? \\n 'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;' \\n And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you, \\n Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds, \\n But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next, \\n To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, \\n Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. \\n Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage! \\n You tallow-face! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Fie, fie! what, are you mad? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Good father, I beseech you on my knees, \\n Hear me with patience but to speak a word. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! \\n I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday, \\n Or never after look me in the face: \\n Speak not, reply not, do not answer me; \\n My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest \\n That God had lent us but this only child; \\n But now I see this one is one too much, \\n And that we have a curse in having her: \\n Out on her, hilding! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n God in heaven bless her! \\n You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, \\n Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n I speak no treason. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n O, God ye god-den. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n May not one speak? \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Peace, you mumbling fool! \\n Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl; \\n For here we need it not. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n You are too hot. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n God's bread! it makes me mad: \\n Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, \\n Alone, in company, still my care hath been \\n To have her match'd: and having now provided \\n A gentleman of noble parentage, \\n Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, \\n Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts, \\n Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man; \\n And then to have a wretched puling fool, \\n A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, \\n To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love, \\n I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.' \\n But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you: \\n Graze where you will you shall not house with me: \\n Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest. \\n Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: \\n An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; \\n And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in \\n the streets, \\n For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, \\n Nor what is mine shall never do thee good: \\n Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, \\n That sees into the bottom of my grief? \\n O, sweet my mother, cast me not away! \\n Delay this marriage for a month, a week; \\n Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed \\n In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word: \\n Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented? \\n My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven; \\n How shall that faith return again to earth, \\n Unless that husband send it me from heaven \\n By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me. \\n Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems \\n Upon so soft a subject as myself! \\n What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy? \\n Some comfort, nurse. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Faith, here it is. \\n Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing, \\n That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; \\n Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. \\n Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, \\n I think it best you married with the county. \\n O, he's a lovely gentleman! \\n Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam, \\n Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye \\n As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, \\n I think you are happy in this second match, \\n For it excels your first: or if it did not, \\n Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were, \\n As living here and you no use of him. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Speakest thou from thy heart? \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n And from my soul too; \\n Or else beshrew them both. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Amen! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n What? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. \\n Go in: and tell my lady I am gone, \\n Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell, \\n To make confession and to be absolved. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! \\n Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, \\n Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue \\n Which she hath praised him with above compare \\n So many thousand times? Go, counsellor; \\n Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. \\n I'll to the friar, to know his remedy: \\n If all else fail, myself have power to die. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT IV \\n\\n SCENE I.  Friar Laurence's cell. \\n Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n On Thursday, sir? the time is very short. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n My father Capulet will have it so; \\n And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n You say you do not know the lady's mind: \\n Uneven is the course, I like it not. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, \\n And therefore have I little talk'd of love; \\n For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. \\n Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous \\n That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, \\n And in his wisdom hastes our marriage, \\n To stop the inundation of her tears; \\n Which, too much minded by herself alone, \\n May be put from her by society: \\n Now do you know the reason of this haste. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Aside   I would I knew not why it should be slow'd. \\n Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter JULIET \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Happily met, my lady and my wife! \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n What must be shall be. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n That's a certain text. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Come you to make confession to this father? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n To answer that, I should confess to you. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Do not deny to him that you love me. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n I will confess to you that I love him. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n If I do so, it will be of more price, \\n Being spoke behind your back, than to your face. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n The tears have got small victory by that; \\n For it was bad enough before their spite. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; \\n And what I spake, I spake it to my face. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n It may be so, for it is not mine own. \\n Are you at leisure, holy father, now; \\n Or shall I come to you at evening mass? \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. \\n My lord, we must entreat the time alone. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n God shield I should disturb devotion! \\n Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye: \\n Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O shut the door! and when thou hast done so, \\n Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help! \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; \\n It strains me past the compass of my wits: \\n I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, \\n On Thursday next be married to this county. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, \\n Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it: \\n If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, \\n Do thou but call my resolution wise, \\n And with this knife I'll help it presently. \\n God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; \\n And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd, \\n Shall be the label to another deed, \\n Or my true heart with treacherous revolt \\n Turn to another, this shall slay them both: \\n Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time, \\n Give me some present counsel, or, behold, \\n 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife \\n Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that \\n Which the commission of thy years and art \\n Could to no issue of true honour bring. \\n Be not so long to speak; I long to die, \\n If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope, \\n Which craves as desperate an execution. \\n As that is desperate which we would prevent. \\n If, rather than to marry County Paris, \\n Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, \\n Then is it likely thou wilt undertake \\n A thing like death to chide away this shame, \\n That copest with death himself to scape from it: \\n And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, \\n From off the battlements of yonder tower; \\n Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk \\n Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; \\n Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house, \\n O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, \\n With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; \\n Or bid me go into a new-made grave \\n And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; \\n Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble; \\n And I will do it without fear or doubt, \\n To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent \\n To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow: \\n To-morrow night look that thou lie alone; \\n Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber: \\n Take thou this vial, being then in bed, \\n And this distilled liquor drink thou off; \\n When presently through all thy veins shall run \\n A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse \\n Shall keep his native progress, but surcease: \\n No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; \\n The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade \\n To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, \\n Like death, when he shuts up the day of life; \\n Each part, deprived of supple government, \\n Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death: \\n And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death \\n Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, \\n And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. \\n Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes \\n To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: \\n Then, as the manner of our country is, \\n In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier \\n Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault \\n Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. \\n In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, \\n Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, \\n And hither shall he come: and he and I \\n Will watch thy waking, and that very night \\n Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. \\n And this shall free thee from this present shame; \\n If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear, \\n Abate thy valour in the acting it. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous \\n In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed \\n To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford. \\n Farewell, dear father! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.

Let me see the county; \\n Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither. \\n Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar, \\n Our whole city is much bound to him. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Nurse, will you go with me into my closet, \\n To help me sort such needful ornaments \\n As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n No, not till Thursday; there is time enough. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt JULIET and Nurse \\n\\n \\n LADY  CAPULET \\n We shall be short in our provision: \\n 'Tis now near night. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Tush, I will stir about, \\n And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife: \\n Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her; \\n I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone; \\n I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! \\n They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself \\n To County Paris, to prepare him up \\n Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light, \\n Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  Juliet's chamber. \\n Enter JULIET and Nurse \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse, \\n I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night, \\n For I have need of many orisons \\n To move the heavens to smile upon my state, \\n Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter LADY CAPULET \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n What, are you busy, ho? need you my help? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries \\n As are behoveful for our state to-morrow: \\n So please you, let me now be left alone, \\n And let the nurse this night sit up with you; \\n For, I am sure, you have your hands full all, \\n In this so sudden business. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Good night: \\n Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. \\n I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, \\n That almost freezes up the heat of life: \\n I'll call them back again to comfort me: \\n Nurse! What should she do here? \\n My dismal scene I needs must act alone. \\n Come, vial. \\n What if this mixture do not work at all? \\n Shall I be married then to-morrow morning? \\n No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there. \\n Laying down her dagger \\n What if it be a poison, which the friar \\n Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead, \\n Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd, \\n Because he married me before to Romeo? \\n I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, \\n For he hath still been tried a holy man. \\n How if, when I am laid into the tomb, \\n I wake before the time that Romeo \\n Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! \\n Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault, \\n To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, \\n And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? \\n Or, if I live, is it not very like, \\n The horrible conceit of death and night, \\n Together with the terror of the place,-- \\n As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, \\n Where, for these many hundred years, the bones \\n Of all my buried ancestors are packed: \\n Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, \\n Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, \\n At some hours in the night spirits resort;-- \\n Alack, alack, is it not like that I, \\n So early waking, what with loathsome smells, \\n And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth, \\n That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:-- \\n O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, \\n Environed with all these hideous fears? \\n And madly play with my forefather's joints? \\n And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? \\n And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, \\n As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? \\n O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost \\n Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body \\n Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay! \\n Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n She falls upon her bed, within the curtains \\n \\n\\n SCENE IV.

I have watch'd ere now \\n All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick. \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; \\n But I will watch you from such watching now. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n A jealous hood, a jealous hood! \\n Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs,\\nand baskets \\n Now, fellow, \\n What's there? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Servant \\n Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Make haste, make haste. \\n Exit First Servant \\n Sirrah, fetch drier logs: \\n Call Peter, he will show thee where they are. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Servant \\n I have a head, sir, that will find out logs, \\n And never trouble Peter for the matter. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha! \\n Thou shalt be logger-head.

What, nurse, I say! \\n Re-enter Nurse \\n Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up; \\n I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste, \\n Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already: \\n Make haste, I say. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE V.

God forgive me, \\n Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! \\n I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam! \\n Ay, let the county take you in your bed; \\n He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be? \\n Undraws the curtains \\n What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! \\n I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady! \\n Alas, alas!

There she lies, \\n Flower as she was, deflowered by him. \\n Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir; \\n My daughter he hath wedded: I will die, \\n And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Have I thought long to see this morning's face, \\n And doth it give me such a sight as this? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! \\n Most miserable hour that e'er time saw \\n In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! \\n But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, \\n But one thing to rejoice and solace in, \\n And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight! \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n O woe!

Alack! my child is dead; \\n And with my child my joys are buried. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not \\n In these confusions. Heaven and yourself \\n Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all, \\n And all the better is it for the maid: \\n Your part in her you could not keep from death, \\n But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. \\n The most you sought was her promotion; \\n For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced: \\n And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced \\n Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? \\n O, in this love, you love your child so ill, \\n That you run mad, seeing that she is well: \\n She's not well married that lives married long; \\n But she's best married that dies married young. \\n Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary \\n On this fair corse; and, as the custom is, \\n In all her best array bear her to church: \\n For though fond nature bids us an lament, \\n Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n All things that we ordained festival, \\n Turn from their office to black funeral; \\n Our instruments to melancholy bells, \\n Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, \\n Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, \\n Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, \\n And all things change them to the contrary. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; \\n And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare \\n To follow this fair corse unto her grave: \\n The heavens do lour upon you for some ill; \\n Move them no more by crossing their high will. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone. \\n \\n\\n \\n Nurse \\n Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up; \\n For, well you know, this is a pitiful case. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter PETER \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's \\n ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.' \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Why 'Heart's ease?' \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My \\n heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump, \\n to comfort me. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now. \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n You will not, then? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n No. \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n I will then give it you soundly. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n What will you give us? \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n No money, on my faith, but the gleek; \\n I will give you the minstrel. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n Then I will give you the serving-creature. \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on \\n your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, \\n I'll fa you; do you note me? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n An you re us and fa us, you note us. \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Musician \\n Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit. \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you \\n with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer \\n me like men: \\n 'When griping grief the heart doth wound, \\n And doleful dumps the mind oppress, \\n Then music with her silver sound'-- \\n why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver \\n sound'? What say you, Simon Catling? \\n \\n\\n \\n Musician \\n Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck? \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Musician \\n I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver. \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost? \\n \\n\\n \\n Third Musician \\n Faith, I know not what to say. \\n \\n\\n \\n PETER \\n O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say \\n for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,' \\n because musicians have no gold for sounding: \\n 'Then music with her silver sound \\n With speedy help doth lend redress.' \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n First Musician \\n What a pestilent knave is this same! \\n \\n\\n \\n Second Musician \\n Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the \\n mourners, and stay dinner. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT \\n\\n\\n\\n ACT V \\n\\n SCENE I.  Mantua. A street. \\n Enter ROMEO \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, \\n My dreams presage some joyful news at hand: \\n My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne; \\n And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit \\n Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. \\n I dreamt my lady came and found me dead-- \\n Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave \\n to think!-- \\n And breathed such life with kisses in my lips, \\n That I revived, and was an emperor. \\n Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd, \\n When but love's shadows are so rich in joy! \\n Enter BALTHASAR, booted \\n News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar! \\n Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? \\n How doth my lady? Is my father well? \\n How fares my Juliet? that I ask again; \\n For nothing can be ill, if she be well. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n Then she is well, and nothing can be ill: \\n Her body sleeps in Capel's monument, \\n And her immortal part with angels lives. \\n I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault, \\n And presently took post to tell it you: \\n O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, \\n Since you did leave it for my office, sir. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Is it even so? then I defy you, stars! \\n Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper, \\n And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n I do beseech you, sir, have patience: \\n Your looks are pale and wild, and do import \\n Some misadventure. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Tush, thou art deceived: \\n Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do. \\n Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n No, my good lord. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n No matter: get thee gone, \\n And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight. \\n Exit BALTHASAR \\n Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night. \\n Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift \\n To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! \\n I do remember an apothecary,-- \\n And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted \\n In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, \\n Culling of simples; meagre were his looks, \\n Sharp misery had worn him to the bones: \\n And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, \\n An alligator stuff'd, and other skins \\n Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves \\n A beggarly account of empty boxes, \\n Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, \\n Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, \\n Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show. \\n Noting this penury, to myself I said \\n 'An if a man did need a poison now, \\n Whose sale is present death in Mantua, \\n Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.' \\n O, this same thought did but forerun my need; \\n And this same needy man must sell it me. \\n As I remember, this should be the house. \\n Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. \\n What, ho! apothecary! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter Apothecary \\n\\n \\n Apothecary \\n Who calls so loud? \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor: \\n Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have \\n A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear \\n As will disperse itself through all the veins \\n That the life-weary taker may fall dead \\n And that the trunk may be discharged of breath \\n As violently as hasty powder fired \\n Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb. \\n \\n\\n \\n Apothecary \\n Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law \\n Is death to any he that utters them. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, \\n And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, \\n Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, \\n Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back; \\n The world is not thy friend nor the world's law; \\n The world affords no law to make thee rich; \\n Then be not poor, but break it, and take this. \\n \\n\\n \\n Apothecary \\n My poverty, but not my will, consents. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I pay thy poverty, and not thy will. \\n \\n\\n \\n Apothecary \\n Put this in any liquid thing you will, \\n And drink it off; and, if you had the strength \\n Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls, \\n Doing more murders in this loathsome world, \\n Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. \\n I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. \\n Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh. \\n Come, cordial and not poison, go with me \\n To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n\\n SCENE II.  Friar Laurence's cell. \\n Enter FRIAR JOHN \\n\\n \\n FRIAR JOHN \\n Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho! \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter FRIAR LAURENCE \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n This same should be the voice of Friar John. \\n Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo? \\n Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR JOHN \\n Going to find a bare-foot brother out \\n One of our order, to associate me, \\n Here in this city visiting the sick, \\n And finding him, the searchers of the town, \\n Suspecting that we both were in a house \\n Where the infectious pestilence did reign, \\n Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; \\n So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo? \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR JOHN \\n I could not send it,--here it is again,-- \\n Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, \\n So fearful were they of infection. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood, \\n The letter was not nice but full of charge \\n Of dear import, and the neglecting it \\n May do much danger. Friar John, go hence; \\n Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight \\n Unto my cell. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR JOHN \\n Brother, I'll go and bring it thee. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Now must I to the monument alone; \\n Within three hours will fair Juliet wake: \\n She will beshrew me much that Romeo \\n Hath had no notice of these accidents; \\n But I will write again to Mantua, \\n And keep her at my cell till Romeo come; \\n Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb! \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n \\n\\n SCENE III.  A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets. \\n Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof: \\n Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. \\n Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along, \\n Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground; \\n So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, \\n Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, \\n But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, \\n As signal that thou hear'st something approach. \\n Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. \\n \\n\\n \\n PAGE \\n Aside   I am almost afraid to stand alone \\n Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. \\n \\n\\n\\n Retires \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,-- \\n O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;-- \\n Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, \\n Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans: \\n The obsequies that I for thee will keep \\n Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. \\n The Page whistles \\n The boy gives warning something doth approach. \\n What cursed foot wanders this way to-night, \\n To cross my obsequies and true love's rite? \\n What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile. \\n \\n\\n Retires \\n Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch,\\nmattock, &c \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. \\n Hold, take this letter; early in the morning \\n See thou deliver it to my lord and father. \\n Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee, \\n Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, \\n And do not interrupt me in my course. \\n Why I descend into this bed of death, \\n Is partly to behold my lady's face; \\n But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger \\n A precious ring, a ring that I must use \\n In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone: \\n But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry \\n In what I further shall intend to do, \\n By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint \\n And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs: \\n The time and my intents are savage-wild, \\n More fierce and more inexorable far \\n Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that: \\n Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n Aside   For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout: \\n His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt. \\n \\n\\n\\n Retires \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, \\n Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth, \\n Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, \\n And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food! \\n \\n\\n\\n Opens the tomb \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n This is that banish'd haughty Montague, \\n That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief, \\n It is supposed, the fair creature died; \\n And here is come to do some villanous shame \\n To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him. \\n Comes forward \\n Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague! \\n Can vengeance be pursued further than death? \\n Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee: \\n Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. \\n Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man; \\n Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone; \\n Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, \\n Put not another sin upon my head, \\n By urging me to fury: O, be gone! \\n By heaven, I love thee better than myself; \\n For I come hither arm'd against myself: \\n Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say, \\n A madman's mercy bade thee run away. \\n \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n I do defy thy conjurations, \\n And apprehend thee for a felon here. \\n \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! \\n \\n\\n\\n They fight \\n\\n \\n PAGE \\n O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exit \\n\\n \\n PARIS \\n O, I am slain! \\n Falls \\n If thou be merciful, \\n Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. \\n \\n\\n\\n Dies \\n\\n \\n ROMEO \\n In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. \\n Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! \\n What said my man, when my betossed soul \\n Did not attend him as we rode? I think \\n He told me Paris should have married Juliet: \\n Said he not so? or did I dream it so? \\n Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, \\n To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, \\n One writ with me in sour misfortune's book! \\n I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave; \\n A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth, \\n For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes \\n This vault a feasting presence full of light. \\n Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd. \\n Laying PARIS in the tomb \\n How oft when men are at the point of death \\n Have they been merry! which their keepers call \\n A lightning before death: O, how may I \\n Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife! \\n Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, \\n Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: \\n Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet \\n Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, \\n And death's pale flag is not advanced there. \\n Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? \\n O, what more favour can I do to thee, \\n Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain \\n To sunder his that was thine enemy? \\n Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet, \\n Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe \\n That unsubstantial death is amorous, \\n And that the lean abhorred monster keeps \\n Thee here in dark to be his paramour? \\n For fear of that, I still will stay with thee; \\n And never from this palace of dim night \\n Depart again: here, here will I remain \\n With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here \\n Will I set up my everlasting rest, \\n And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars \\n From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last! \\n Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you \\n The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss \\n A dateless bargain to engrossing death! \\n Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide! \\n Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on \\n The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark! \\n Here's to my love! \\n Drinks \\n O true apothecary! \\n Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. \\n \\n\\n Dies \\n Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR\\nLAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night \\n Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there? \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend, \\n What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light \\n To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern, \\n It burneth in the Capel's monument. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, \\n One that you love. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Who is it? \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n Romeo. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n How long hath he been there? \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n Full half an hour. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Go with me to the vault. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n I dare not, sir \\n My master knows not but I am gone hence; \\n And fearfully did menace me with death, \\n If I did stay to look on his intents. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me: \\n O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n As I did sleep under this yew-tree here, \\n I dreamt my master and another fought, \\n And that my master slew him. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n Romeo! \\n Advances \\n Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains \\n The stony entrance of this sepulchre? \\n What mean these masterless and gory swords \\n To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? \\n Enters the tomb \\n Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too? \\n And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour \\n Is guilty of this lamentable chance! \\n The lady stirs. \\n \\n\\n\\n JULIET wakes \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n O comfortable friar! where is my lord? \\n I do remember well where I should be, \\n And there I am. Where is my Romeo? \\n \\n\\n\\n Noise within \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest \\n Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep: \\n A greater power than we can contradict \\n Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. \\n Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; \\n And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee \\n Among a sisterhood of holy nuns: \\n Stay not to question, for the watch is coming; \\n Come, go, good Juliet, \\n Noise again \\n I dare no longer stay. \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. \\n Exit FRIAR LAURENCE \\n What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand? \\n Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end: \\n O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop \\n To help me after? I will kiss thy lips; \\n Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, \\n To make die with a restorative. \\n Kisses him \\n Thy lips are warm. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Watchman \\n Within   Lead, boy: which way? \\n \\n\\n \\n JULIET \\n Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger! \\n Snatching ROMEO's dagger \\n This is thy sheath; \\n Stabs herself \\n there rust, and let me die. \\n \\n\\n Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies \\n Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS \\n\\n \\n PAGE \\n This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Watchman \\n The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard: \\n Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach. \\n Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain, \\n And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, \\n Who here hath lain these two days buried. \\n Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets: \\n Raise up the Montagues: some others search: \\n We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; \\n But the true ground of all these piteous woes \\n We cannot without circumstance descry. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR \\n\\n \\n Second Watchman \\n Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Watchman \\n Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither. \\n \\n\\n\\n Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE \\n\\n \\n Third Watchman \\n Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps: \\n We took this mattock and this spade from him, \\n As he was coming from this churchyard side. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Watchman \\n A great suspicion: stay the friar too. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter the PRINCE and Attendants \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n What misadventure is so early up, \\n That calls our person from our morning's rest? \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n The people in the street cry Romeo, \\n Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run, \\n With open outcry toward our monument. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n What fear is this which startles in our ears? \\n \\n\\n \\n First Watchman \\n Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; \\n And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, \\n Warm and new kill'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. \\n \\n\\n \\n First Watchman \\n Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man; \\n With instruments upon them, fit to open \\n These dead men's tombs. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! \\n This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house \\n Is empty on the back of Montague,-- \\n And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom! \\n \\n\\n \\n LADY CAPULET \\n O me! this sight of death is as a bell, \\n That warns my old age to a sepulchre. \\n \\n\\n\\n Enter MONTAGUE and others \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Come, Montague; for thou art early up, \\n To see thy son and heir more early down. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night; \\n Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath: \\n What further woe conspires against mine age? \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Look, and thou shalt see. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n O thou untaught! what manners is in this? \\n To press before thy father to a grave? \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, \\n Till we can clear these ambiguities, \\n And know their spring, their head, their \\n true descent; \\n And then will I be general of your woes, \\n And lead you even to death: meantime forbear, \\n And let mischance be slave to patience. \\n Bring forth the parties of suspicion. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n I am the greatest, able to do least, \\n Yet most suspected, as the time and place \\n Doth make against me of this direful murder; \\n And here I stand, both to impeach and purge \\n Myself condemned and myself excused. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Then say at once what thou dost know in this. \\n \\n\\n \\n FRIAR LAURENCE \\n I will be brief, for my short date of breath \\n Is not so long as is a tedious tale. \\n Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; \\n And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife: \\n I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day \\n Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death \\n Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city, \\n For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined. \\n You, to remove that siege of grief from her, \\n Betroth'd and would have married her perforce \\n To County Paris: then comes she to me, \\n And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean \\n To rid her from this second marriage, \\n Or in my cell there would she kill herself. \\n Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art, \\n A sleeping potion; which so took effect \\n As I intended, for it wrought on her \\n The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo, \\n That he should hither come as this dire night, \\n To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, \\n Being the time the potion's force should cease. \\n But he which bore my letter, Friar John, \\n Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight \\n Return'd my letter back. Then all alone \\n At the prefixed hour of her waking, \\n Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; \\n Meaning to keep her closely at my cell, \\n Till I conveniently could send to Romeo: \\n But when I came, some minute ere the time \\n Of her awaking, here untimely lay \\n The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. \\n She wakes; and I entreated her come forth, \\n And bear this work of heaven with patience: \\n But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; \\n And she, too desperate, would not go with me, \\n But, as it seems, did violence on herself. \\n All this I know; and to the marriage \\n Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this \\n Miscarried by my fault, let my old life \\n Be sacrificed, some hour before his time, \\n Unto the rigour of severest law. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n We still have known thee for a holy man. \\n Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this? \\n \\n\\n \\n BALTHASAR \\n I brought my master news of Juliet's death; \\n And then in post he came from Mantua \\n To this same place, to this same monument. \\n This letter he early bid me give his father, \\n And threatened me with death, going in the vault, \\n I departed not and left him there. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n Give me the letter; I will look on it. \\n Where is the county's page, that raised the watch? \\n Sirrah, what made your master in this place? \\n \\n\\n \\n PAGE \\n He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; \\n And bid me stand aloof, and so I did: \\n Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; \\n And by and by my master drew on him; \\n And then I ran away to call the watch. \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n This letter doth make good the friar's words, \\n Their course of love, the tidings of her death: \\n And here he writes that he did buy a poison \\n Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal \\n Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. \\n Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague! \\n See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, \\n That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. \\n And I for winking at your discords too \\n Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n O brother Montague, give me thy hand: \\n This is my daughter's jointure, for no more \\n Can I demand. \\n \\n\\n \\n MONTAGUE \\n But I can give thee more: \\n For I will raise her statue in pure gold; \\n That while Verona by that name is known, \\n There shall no figure at such rate be set \\n As that of true and faithful Juliet. \\n \\n\\n \\n CAPULET \\n As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie; \\n Poor sacrifices of our enmity! \\n \\n\\n \\n PRINCE \\n A glooming peace this morning with it brings; \\n The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head: \\n Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; \\n Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished: \\n For never was a story of more woe \\n Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. \\n \\n\\n\\n Exeunt \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \""
